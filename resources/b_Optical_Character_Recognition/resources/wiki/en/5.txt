West a Fool Away is an album by the Swedish rock 'n roll singer Eddie Meduza. It was released in 1984. The album mixed serious English rock songs with funny songs in Swedish. Side 1 had mainly English songs and side 2 was entirely Swedish except for the title track.

Two versions of the album exist: the original "Stoppad" (Recalled) edition, which was only released on vinyl and cassette and the "Laglig" (Legal) edition, which got a CD release in 2002. The album caused a minor controversy when track 12 of the Stoppad edition, "Heil Hitler", was played on a radio station. The track was intended to be an anti war and anti Nazi song, but its title could be misconstrued as endorsement of Nazism. As a result, CBS was ordered to have the album recalled and all unsold stock was pulled off Swedish shelves. The offending track was replaced with "Leader of the Rockers", a cover version of a track from Eddie's 1979 album "Eddie Meduza and the Roarin' Cadillacs".

In 2004, Kammerorchester Basel played Handel's opera "Lotario" both in Basel and at the Handel Festival Halle. They recorded all of Beethoven's symphonies, led by conductor Giovanni Antonini. A review of Symphony No. 5 noted the "period practice lightness, despite the use of modern instrument", "refinement and delicacy", "fleet footedness in the scherzo particular from the running basses and cellos at the start of the trio", and the finale "thrillingly and refreshingly done, remarkable, once again, for the care and attention to details". In 2011, the orchestra accompanied Andreas Scholl in a recording of Bach cantatas including "Ich habe genug", BWV 82 and "Gott soll allein mein Herze haben", BWV 169.

Stephen Bradberry (born c. 1966, Chicago, Illinois) is a community organizer in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. In 2005, he served as the lead organizer for the New Orleans chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). He was awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award for his work on behalf of victims of Hurricane Katrina. Bradberry is a graduate of Dillard University who later worked as a public school teacher. He became active as a community organizer through the Umoja Committee of New Orleans. Following Hurricane Katrina, Bradberry organized grassroots campaigns to support the participation of low income families in the recovery process. Among other initiatives, he led a campaign for the Lower Ninth Ward, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by Katrina, to be rebuilt as housing rather than turned into wetlands. He also objected to remarks by businessman Jimmy Reiss and US Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson about rebuilding the city differently from before, stating, "It's almost so obvious that there's a concerted plan to make this a whiter city." He also argued that the 2006 mayoral election, already postponed due to Katrina, should be further delayed to allow time for more of the city's residents to return. In the same year, Bradberry and ACORN filed a successful lawsuit in federal court to force the Federal Emergency Management Agency to resume its housing payments to Katrina victims. As of 2011, he continued to lobby for federal assistance to the area, arguing that it still had not economically recovered six years later. In 2005, the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights recognized his efforts with its Human Rights Award. Bradberry was the first African American to win. The award citation cited his work following Katrina as well as his campaigns of "promoting a living wage, preventing predatory lending, preventing lead poisoning in children, and increasing voter participation". Future U.S. President Barack Obama spoke at the ceremony, saying of Bradberry, "Somewhere there's always been people like Steve Bradberry who believe that this isn't the way it's supposed to be ... People who believe that while evil and suffering will always exist, this is a country that has been fueled by small miracles and boundless dreams." In the lead up to the 2008 presidential election, Bradberry served as national campaign coordinator for ACORN's "Get Out the Vote" efforts. After ACORN reported that several of its workers had falsified voter registration cards, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation into several ACORN chapters. Bradberry responded that ACORN had self reported the fraud as required by regulations and was assisting the process rather than undermining it. Following 2010's Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Bradberry called for federal initiatives to partner with local communities affected by the spill. He also lobbied for "a separate health task force that can focus solely on testing, monitoring, and studying the long term health issues from exposure to crude and dispersants". Bradberry currently serves as the Executive Director of the Alliance Institute, an organization that seeks "to provide individuals, families, and organizations with the skills and information necessary for them to fully participate in the decision making processes that affect them in their homes, neighborhoods and communities."

Paul Pozonsky is a former judge of the Courts of Common Pleas in Washington County, Pennsylvania. In his capacity as judge, he presided over criminal trials, summary appeals, juvenile treatment court, and treatment court. After coming under investigation concerning missing drug court evidence, he left for Alaska and later resigned his seat. He pleaded guilty to three of six counts for which he was later indicted, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Personal background and early legal career. A native of Muse, Pennsylvania, Pozonsky graduated from Canon McMillan High School in 1973. In 1977, he graduated "magna cum laude" from West Virginia University. After earning a law degree from Duquesne University School of Law in 1980, he practiced law. He was elected magisterial district judge for the McDonald and Cecil Township areas in 1983. His campaign highlighted his legal experience. In that position, he president of the region's Special Court Judge Association of Pennsylvania. In 1997, he was nominated by the association for the prestigious John Jeffers Memorial Award, given to individuals who are "considered instrumental in leadership and professionalism in the courts." His second wife filed for divorce on May 19, 2015, in Kenai, Alaska. The uncontested divorce became final on September 28, 2015. Career as County Judge. In 1997, he defeated Charles Kurowski in the election to replace retiring Judge Thomas Terputac. After his election to the county bench, he left the private practice that he had maintained while serving as a magisterial district judge. In 1998, he was selected to be one of 15 members of the ethics committee of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges, which advises judges on ethical quandaries. On March 29, 2004, Pozonsky dismissed 51 charges against a driver whose license had been suspended for 30 years. In 2004, Pozonsky and Washington County District Attorney John Pettit established the county's first drug treatment court. Pozonsky was successful in his 2007 retention election. His campaign highlighted his high level of recommendation from members of the Pennsylvania Bar Association and his 9 year membership on the Ethics Committee of Pennsylvania State Trial Judges. In 2011, Pozonsky presided over a case brought by a family who alleged their health was damaged by fracking petrocarbon wells drilled on property immediately adjacent to their home and the value of their farmstead was depressed. Four Marcellus Shale gas wells, compressor stations plus a 3 acre wastewater impoundment were located next to their 10 acre farm in Mt. Pleasant. The case was settled for $750,000 but Pozonsky barred the media from his courtroom and sealed the settlement file despite extensive efforts of the press to get its details released. Later career. Suspension. On May 24, 2012 Washington County's President Judge Debbie O'Dell Seneca issued an order suspending Pozonsky's drug treatment court. On May 31, she issued a subsequent order stripping Pozonsky of his criminal caseload, instead assigning him giving civil cases and nonjury trials. Previously, Pozonsky had been responsible for 60% to 70% of the county's criminal docket. Tenure in Alaska. Shortly after the Judge President's actions, Pozonsky then left for a 2 week trip to Alaska, where his wife had family. On June 29, 2012, Judge Pozonsky resigned from the bench, citing discussions with, and the needs of, his family. In July 2012, Judge Pozonsky's attorney confirmed the existence of an investigation by the Pennsylvania Attorney General. In October 2012, he was a questionable hire as a Worker's Compensation Board hearing officer by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. His candidacy was accepted after the filing deadline had passed, and he lacked the resident's preference for the opening. His wife's family had deep Republican party connections, with his brother in law, Chuck Kopp who was briefly employed first as Governor Sarah Palin's Public Safety Commissioner, then as staff at the time to then Senator Fred Dyson. She served on the Soldotna, Alaska City Council and the Alaska Commission on Judicial Conduct, and was close with former Lieutenant Governor Loren Leman. Under pressure, he resigned that post in December 2012. Then governor, Republican Sean Parnell, ordered an investigation regarding the circumstances of his hire. By January 2013, the investigation was said to be continuing, but all parties publicly solicited for details denied knowledge of, and involvement in, the circumstances of the anomalous employment, including his being paid at what was a substantially higher rate than had been advertised. The Parnell administration denied access to critical correspondence regarding the matter that had been requested by the media, claiming exemptions over personnel privacy issues. Charges. He was charged with stealing cocaine from evidence and numerous other offenses, in May 2013. Investigators said 291.2 grams (10.27 ounces) of cocaine was either missing, tampered with or replaced with baking soda. Though uncharged, considerable other case evidence went unaccounted for, including other drugs and cash, which Judge Pozonsky claimed to have personally destroyed, sua sponte. He challenged the search of his former Pennsylvania judicial office that revealed evidence of criminal conduct. A Pozonsky motion to compel testimony from Debbie O'Dell Seneca, the president judge who issued the administrative order to search his office and preserve evidence, was filed in June 2014. In a March, 2015 plea bargain, Pozonsky pleaded guilty to three of his six indictment counts and the prosecution did not request that he get jail time. Sentence. Prosecutor Michael Ahwesh told Judge Daniel Howsare that Pozonsky "turned the courthouse into his stash house and made law enforcement into his private supplier of cocaine," decrying his arrogance in continuing to serve on the bench after he first entered drug rehabilitation. Pozonsky was sentenced to serve 30 days to 23.5 months in jail and 2 years probation, on July 13, 2015. He was immediately given work release and was released from jail on August 11, 2015. Pozonsky also forfeited his $98,000 annual pension and lifetime health benefits. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court temporarily suspended his law license on August 15, 2015. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled 5 2 on January 18, 2018, to permanently disbar Pozonsky from law practice following the recommendation of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, rather than suspending him, as he had requested. Justice Debra Todd, writing the majority opinion, said his conduct was particularly egregious, and had turned the court's proceedings that he had handled into "a shame and a farce." Justice Baer filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Donohue joined, noting that Pozonsky had notably failed to file any medical evidence connecting his conduct to his addiction, which might have resulted in suspension rather than disbarment.

In 1982 the Pilgrims' College was founded as a primary school for boys in the exclusive suburb of La Horqueta. The school grew rapidly and in 1987 the first class of Bilingual Bachelors graduated from high school. In 1988 Miss Beatriz Mottet's kindergarten was incorporated into the Pilgrims' family, now offering a full K 12 education. By 2001 the request of many families and former students together with the increasingly growing area of Pacheco in Tigre resulted in a second campus being founded and the Board deciding to incorporate girls into the traditional all boys school. The Co educational system is chosen and since 2004 girls have also welcomed into San Isidro. The School. The school name, "College of the Pilgrims", symbolizes our status of men walking to the house of the Father.

The Head Boy and Head Girl are in charge of making announcements, and sometimes provide light entertainment. Many inter house competitions occur, mostly in the field of sport. The sports term has a different calendar from the three academic terms as it is divided into the Autumn and Spring semesters. Each of them promotes different activities. The Autumn Semester focuses mainly on rugby for boys, hockey for girls and volleyball for both. During the Spring term football and athletics are trained. The school also participates in many inter school tournaments with other British tradition schools.

Asclepias sullivantii is a species of flowering plant in the milkweed genus, "Asclepias". Common names include prairie milkweed, Sullivant's milkweed, and smooth milkweed. It is native to North America, where it occurs in the central United States and Ontario in Canada. Description. This is a perennial herb growing from deep rhizomes. The stem is 40 centimeters to just over one meter tall. The ovate, pointed leaves are oppositely arranged and hairless. The leaves are also thick and leathery, with wavy margins, reddish midveins. They curve up on the stem. Pale to deep pinkish purple flowers are borne in rounded clusters from the leaf axils. The fruit is a greenish follicle. The flowers are insect pollinated, but the plant often reproduces vegetatively via the rhizome. This species is very similar to "Asclepias syriaca", the common milkweed, and the two easily hybridize. Common milkweed can be distinguished by several characters. Its blunt tipped leaf blades have a coating of hairs on the undersides and are straight on the stem, not curving up. The flowers are smaller and more numerous, and the surface of the follicle is rougher. Habitat. The native habitat of the plant includes prairie and meadows. It grows in moist areas, such as river bottomland. The original range of "Asclepias sullivantii" was the tall grass prairie, but very little of that habitat remains because of wide spread conversion to farming. In Minnesota it is listed as threatened species, mainly because of habitat loss, and the remaining plants are found on old railroad right ways that preserve small prairie remnants. It is restricted to mesic tall grass prairies and seems to have little ability to survive degraded habitats. Ecology. Insects that take nectar from the plant include bumblebees and other bees, wasps, ants, flies, and butterflies. The caterpillars of the monarch butterfly feed on the foliage. The larva of the milkweed leaf miner ("Liriomyza asclepiades") mine the leaves. Aphids that can be found on the plant include the yellow milkweed aphid ("Aphis nerii"), black aphid ("Aphis rumicis"), and the green peach aphid ("Myzus persicae"). The ruby throated hummingbird takes nectar. Toxicity. Most "Asclepias" are toxic if consumed in large quantities due to cardiac glycoside content.

Kazimieras Ragulskis (5 October 1926 in Klovainiai, Pakruojis district) is a Lithuanian scientist and engineer. He created the scientific school of precise vibromechanics and vibroengineering. He is Dr. (1954), Habil. Dr. (1963), Professor Emeritus, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (later of the Russian Academy of Sciences) (1987), member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences (1987), Honored Inventor of the USSR (1987). Biographical facts. Ragulskis was in the family of Mykolas Ragulskis and Liucija Kazlauskait Ragulskien . He attended the Primary School of Klovainiai (1934 1938), Primary School of Pakruojis (1938 1940), Gymnasium of Linkuva (1940 1946), Kaunas Polytechnical Institute (1946 1951), and post graduate studies in the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1952 1954). In 1954 1963 he worked at the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. From 1963 he worked at the Kaunas Polytechnical Institute where he created Scientific Center "Vibrotechnika" and was its scientific supervisor. Scientific achievements. He created some new and developed known non linear effects and qualities. For this purpose he created methods for investigation of essentially non linear dynamical systems. He created methods based on non linear phenomena which enable to transform vibrations, waves and energy into continuous motions or motions of desirable type that are one dimensional or multi dimensional. He created new methods and means for experimental investigations, basis for creation of systems the operation of which is based on new principles. The created systems ensure high precision of positioning of bodies in space, of performing complicated trajectories and laws of motions and of ensuring the prescribed stable shapes of systems. Ragulskis with scientists supervised by him and working with him created basis of theory of separate types of mechanical systems, created inventions and patents, innovations and their practical implementations. Original precise devices, manipulators and robots have been created, which found application in various branches of industry and science. K. Ragulskis created new scientific domain, the so called precise vibromechanics and vibroengineering. He created new and developed known effects and qualities of nonlinear dynamical systems, formulated scientific backgrounds of separate directions of this domain, created principles for the creation of new systems, which together with scientists supervised by him developed up to the applied scientific results for engineering practice. The created scientific domain of precise vibromechanics and vibroengineering is not of functional character, because it is applicable in all areas (industry, aerospace technology, medicine, biology, art). In this scientific domain the scientific directions of stabilization, robotisation, control were created, which are based on vibrations, waves and nonlinear effects and qualities of dynamical systems. He is the author and co author of 28 monographs, of 1750 inventions and patents and of hundreds of scientific works. He was Editor in Chief of scientific journal "Vibrotechnika" (69 issues in the Russian language), of the journal "Vibration Engineering" and now of the international journals "Journal of Vibroengineering" and "Journal of Measurements in Engineering". He was editor in chief of the series of books "Library of Vibration Engineering" (published in the USSR and the USA) and also of some other publications. He was scientific supervisor or consultant of about 300 defended doctoral and habilitated doctoral dissertations.

Villa Haas is a historical villa in the small city of Sinn, Hesse located at the western edge of the H rre in Germany (Lahn Dill Kreis). The villa, the park and the surrounding streets "Hansastrasse / Rudolfstrasse" are cultural monuments due to their historical and artistical significance. History. The manor house, the outbuildings and the garden are designed by the Herborner architect Ludwig Hofmann (1862 1933), who was in 1892 appointed by Privy Councillor of Commerce Rudolf Haas, owner of the opposite located "Neuhoffnungsh tte". He was cofounder of the association of German Eisenh ttenleute , called today steel institute VDEh, and member of the renominated Nassau association of natural history. The Neuhoffnungsh tte with its iron mines had from its Nassautic beginnings until the Second World War a high strategic importance; it was the economic basis for the metallic prosperity of this area. In 1978 Dr. Klaus F. M ller acquired the villa and park as a co founder of the German and Europe oral implantology; he used parts of the estate for practical laboratory and advanced training. Architecture. To the style elements of the two story, high volume estate belong rich carved stone formations above the basement level, and window and gable motifs framed with sandstone, that are geared to the German Renaissance Revival architecture. The roof and gable formations with the bell tower look very picturesque. This total impression is strengthened by the superior stairtower with roof helmet, the mining symbol, and the stained glass with motifs of Rhine romanticism as well as the detailed facades. The artistic interior d cor consists of beautiful stucco and wood work of different historical styles. Also worth protecting components are the small Chinese pavilion (tea house) and the wrought iron main gate. Technical unusual features. These are for example a dumbwaiter (elevator), electrical night storage heaters and a lobster tank with, at this time, new air supply. The old mechanical tower clock was developed and constructed by Perrot (Calw). Later the clock gets a rare electro mechanical addition. It combines chime works and winch with two electric motors. The mechanical circuit is steered by a mercury switch. The power transmission is made by a vee belt and is still working today. Garden. The Grade II listed garden area contains, besides rare plants, shrubs and trees, many stylistic elements of the historical park, like the ruin with the ice house, the cave, the arcades, the pond, the rondell, the fountains, the cherubs, etc. The Chinese pavilion teahouse and the former pavilion which was located at the Dill (river) cliffs is going back to an idea of the German former colonial officer Retzlaff in Tsingtao. The allusions of a horse path closed in the English style landscape garden are only rudimentarily available. The park is one of the few preserved recreations of historicism (art) and contains over one hundred different plant species. It is part of the territory Beilstein / H rre, which was described by Johann Daniel Leers in his book "Flora Herbornensis" in the biodiversity with exact locations in 1775. These listings are according to Karl L ber "of unsurpassed precision and enable still today an effortless verification." (Quote translated from German). Villa Haas today. The property is privately owned and can only be visited on request. As a beautiful backdrop, villa and park are used for photo shoots, cultural events, commercials and films. All proceeds go to a social foundation for education in Kampala and Jinja, Uganda, the 22Stars Foundation.
The NDR Radiophilharmonie is a German radio orchestra, affiliated with the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) in Hanover, the capital of Lower Saxony. The orchestra principally gives concerts in the "Gro er Sendesaal" of the "Landesfunkhaus Niedersachsen". A historical precursor orchestra was the "Nieders chsisches Sinfonie Orchester", a radio orchestra that was affiliated with the "Nordische Rundfunk Aktiengesellschaft" since the late 1920s. Following World War II, with the founding of the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR), the current orchestra was founded in 1950 originally as the "Rundfunkorchester Hannover". Willy Steiner was the first chief conductor, beginning in 1950, and held the post until 1975. During his tenure, the orchestra later changed its name to the "Radiophilharmonie Hannover". In 2003, the orchestra took its current name of the "NDR Radiophilharmonie". After Steiner, chief conductors have Bernhard Klee, Eiji ue and Eivind Gullberg Jensen. Since 2009, ue has held the title of conductor laureate ("Ehrendirigent") with the orchestra. Since 2014, the orchestra's current chief conductor has been Andrew Manze. In March 2017, the orchestra announced the extension of Manze's contract through to 2021. In February 2019, the orchestra announced a further extension of Manze's contract to 2023.

Kue putu or putu bambu is an Indonesian "kue". It is made of rice flour called "suji" and coloured green with pandan leaves, filled with palm sugar, steamed in bamboo tubes (hence the name), and served with dessicated coconut. This traditional bite sized snack is commonly found in maritime Southeast Asia, particularly in Java, Indonesia, where it is called "putu bumbung". "Kue putu" is usually sold by street vendors and can be found in traditional markets, along with other "kues". "Kue putu" can also be found in the Netherlands due to its colonial ties with Indonesia. Ingredients and cooking method. It consists of rice flour with green pandan leaf colouring, filled with ground palm sugar. This green coconut rice flour ingredients with palm sugar filling is filled into bamboo tube container. Subsequently, the filled bamboo tubes are steamed upon a steam cooker with small holes opening to blow the hot steam. The cooked tubular cakes then pushed out from the bamboo tube container, and served with grated coconut. Etymology and variations. In Javanese, "bumbung" means "bamboo" or "a hollow cylindrical object; a tube". As the dish began to spread across the country, the name was later translated to Indonesian "putu bambu" (bambu: "bamboo"). Hence the name, as it is made by filling a bamboo tube with the ingredients (see the above picture). Variations of "kue putu" are often in the shapes or fillings. "Kue putu" of different shapes with almost identical ingredients, fillings and recipes exist in Southeast Asia. The white colored, flatter disc shaped "putu" is called "putu piring" (Malay for disc/plate "putu") and is more common in Malaysia, Kerala and Sri Lanka, while thicker and more round white or green coloured "putu mangkok" (Indonesian for bowl "putu") is found more in Indonesia. In Singapore, however, "putu mangkok" is called "kueh tutu". Traditionally "kue putu" is filled with palm sugar. Today, however, there are several new variations using different fillings, such as chocolate or "abon" (beef floss). Similar dishes. In the Philippines, "puto" is a generic name for any steamed rice cake. A type of "puto" very similar to "kue putu" is "puto bumb ng" which is also cooked in bamboo tubes ("bumb ng" in Tagalog). However "puto bumb ng" does not use pandan and is traditionally cooked as whole grains, rather than rice flour. It also uses a special purple variety of glutinous rice called "pirurutong" which gives it a deep purple colour. In India (Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) and Sri Lanka, a similar dish is known as "puttu" or "pittu", though it is a savoury dish rather than a dessert.

Sadruddin Shah, also known as Rinchan, was the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir. He ruled Kashmir from 1320 to 1323 and was instrumental in establishing Islam in Kashmir. He was directly Influenced by Bulbul Shah. He is known by different versions of his name: Rinchana, Richan, Rinchan Shah, Rinchan Malik, and Malik Rinchan. Early life and ascension to the throne. Rinchan, whose full name was Lhachan Gyalbu Rinchana, was a Buddhist prince from Ladakh, and the son of the Ladakh King, Lhachan Ngos gruba, who ruled Ladakh from 1290 to 1320. He revolted against his uncle, the ruler of Ladakh, but was defeated and fled to Kashmir. Raja Suhadeva appointed Rinchan as a minister. A Muslim from Swat named Shah Mir was appointed as a minister in Kashmir by Suhadeva and he became good friend of Rinchan. Mongols under their leader Zulchu, invaded Kashmir with 70,000 soldiers and defeated Suhadeva, who fled to Tibet. After the departure of Mongols, his prime minister, Ramachandra, took advantage of the anarchy and occupied the throne. He appointed Rinchan as an administrator. Rinchan became ambitious. He sent a force in the fort in the guise of merchants, who took Ramachandra's men by surprise. Ramachandra was killed and his family were taken prisoners. Rinchan married Ramachandra's daughter Kota and became the ruler of Kashmir. Conversion to Islam and later life. The Sufi missionaries from the Middle East and Central Asia had settled in Kashmir and had converted some Kashmiris to Islam.

South Brother Island is an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean, part of the Andaman Archipelago. It is located in the Duncan Passage, about 9.5 kilometre northeast of Little Andaman Island. It is part of the South Andaman district of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a Union Territory of India. The island is roughly bean shaped, about 1800 m by 630 m, with a broad bay on the north side. It is almost flat, thickly wooded, fringed by a narrow beach and surrounded by a reefs. The central part is depressed and becomes a lake in the rainy season. The island hosts a 1.24 km2 wildlife sanctuary, established 1987. By the end of the 19th century, the island was occasionally visited by the Onge of Little Andaman to catch sea turtles; one explorer reports finding huts "with neat charpoys of bamboos" capable of holding 30 people. The island seemed to be their limit in disputes with the Great Andamanese. It has been conjectured to be part of the route for the Onge expansion into south Great Andaman Island in the wake of the Great Andamanese tribes, around 1890 to 1930.
The Britten Pears Orchestra, formerly The Snape Maltings Training Orchestra, is the youth orchestra of the Britten Pears Young Artists Programme at Snape Maltings, run by the Aldeburgh Festival. Since the very first course in 1972, over 10,000 young artists have attended what started as the Britten Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, and is now called the Britten Pears Young Artist Programme. The programme aims to bridge the gap between conservatoires and professional life, offering unique development and performance opportunities to young musicians. Many have gone on to become leading musicians in their own right. Masterclasses for singers, ensembles, instrumentalists and composers are held from March until October. There are also opportunities for emerging young professional musicians to work with leading conductors, soloists and orchestral principals in both the Britten Pears Orchestra and the Britten Pears Baroque Orchestra. Many of the masterclasses are open to the public, and each course culminates in a public performance, including at the Aldeburgh Festival and Snape Proms. Auditions are held across the world, now using modern technology to access countries on the other side of the globe. In 2012, the Britten Pears Orchestra was conducted by Antonello Manacorda, performing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at Snape Maltings Concert Hall at Easter. Previous conductors of the BPO include Edward Gardner, Oliver Knussen, Kirill Karabits, Vasily Petrenko and Robin Ticciati. The Britten Pears Baroque Orchestra, formed in 1992, is formed each year to work on baroque repertoire, and previous tutors have included period specialists Richard Egarr, Emmanuelle Ha m, Laurence Cummings, Andreas Scholl and Harry Bicket. They presented Rameau's Na s as part of the 2012 Snape Proms under Christophe Rousset. In 2012, as part of the Cultural Olympiad, the Aldeburgh World Orchestra was formed, conducted by Sir Mark Elder. Young musicians from across the globe submitted their auditions on YouTube, and an international ensemble of around 124 young musicians came to Suffolk to train and perform both in the Concert Hall in Snape and as part of the BBC Promenade Concert season at the Royal Albert Hall, as well as on a short European tour. In 2012, Aldeburgh Strings was created to perform under the baton of Markus D urnet at the 2012 Britten Weekend, when the programme included Britten's "Prelude and Fugue", "Lachrymae" and "In memoriam Dennis Brain".

The Britten Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies was founded in 1977 in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, following the success both of the master classes held for singers by Peter Pears from 1972, and of the subsequent courses for string players. The School grew to offer a varied programme of practical and academic courses for young musicians and singers at the start of their professional career. Master classes have been taught by such distinguished visiting faculty members as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Murray Perahia and Pierre Fournier. The successor of the school, the Britten Pears Young Artist Programme, continues to provide training for outstanding young professionals from around the world and also manages courses for the Britten Pears Orchestra, formerly The Snape Maltings Training Orchestra. The contemporary composition and performance course was founded by Oliver Knussen and Colin Matthews in 1992. More recently there has been in addition a digital media course, called New Music/New Media. In September 2012, the course was led by Rolf Wallin, Tansy Davies, and Alexander Refsum Jensenius, co founder of the Oslo Laptop Orchestra. String quartets come together each spring and present a weekly recital of "work in progress" at the Jubilee Hall, and in late summer the International Academy of String Quartets provides further opportunities for working on repertoire. Menahem Pressler, Pierre Laurent Aimard and the Arditti Quartet have all taught masterclasses.

Edwin Deakin (May 21, 1838 May 11, 1923) was a British American artist best known for his romantic landscapes as well as his architectural studies, especially the Spanish colonial missions of California. His still lifes are considered to be some of the finest of the genre. Deakin is one of the artists who popularized scenes of San Francisco's Chinatown. His sensitive and highly publicized depictions of the deteriorating missions drew public attention to the necessity of restoring these historically important monuments. Life. Deakin was born in Sheffield, England, on May 21, 1838. He was apprenticed at the age of 12 to a business which painted landscapes and floral designs on furniture in the "Japanese style," but he received no formal training. By 18, he was a notable landscape artist. He emigrated to the US in 1856 with his family to the city of Chicago, where his father opened a hardware store and Edwin's occupation was listed in the Census as a "case maker." On June 21, 1865 Edwin Deakin married the 21 year old Isabel Fox, also an emigrant from England. The following year saw the birth of their son Oscar Edwin Deakin, who became a talented painter, but died at the age of 30. The Deakins also had a daughter, Edna, who became an architect. San Francisco. Just prior to 1870 Edwin, along with his entire extended family, moved to San Francisco, California. He quickly established a successful career as a painter of the untamed California wilderness. Although he consigned his paintings to private commercial galleries and was a director and frequent exhibitor at the San Francisco Art Association (SFAA), he sold most of his canvases through public auctions. He became an exhibiting member of the Graphic Club and Bohemian Club. In 1874 he exhibited a Lake Tahoe scene at the Chicago Academy of Arts. Three years later he left on a grand tour of Europe, where he painted primarily in England, France and Switzerland, and exhibited at the Paris Salon. He returned in May 1879 to San Francisco. The first showings of his new European paintings in San Francisco garnered much attention. He exhibited dozens of paintings to positive reviews at the California State Fair between 1879 and 1889. He traveled extensively through the Midwest and had prolonged stays in both Denver (1882 83) and Salt Lake City (1883). Deakin's highly publicized disputes with the "rebels" of the San Francisco art colony caused him to withdraw in 1885 as an exhibiting member of the SFAA. At this time his still lifes of pendulous grapes became extremely popular and were much imitated. During one of his several trips to New York City he published a series of articles which called for the standardization of canvas sizes, a common practice in Europe that allowed for the mass production of cheaper frames. Berkeley. In 1891, Deakin moved with his wife and two daughters to the university town of Berkeley, just across the bay from San Francisco, where he built a large residence and studio gallery. He soon began a tradition of holding an annual studio exhibit open to the public. Deakin still maintained a small sales office in San Francisco and continued to contribute his paintings to that city's auctions and private galleries. His one man show in April 1900 at the Palace Hotel featured all of his 21 California Spanish mission paintings, many in elaborate iconographic frames designed by the artist himself. His campaign to save the missions was the subject of a highly laudatory article in the Washington, D.C. "Herald". Deakin exhibited frequently at public venues in Oakland as well as in Berkeley where he actively supported the creation of the Berkeley Art Association in 1907. He helped to design and decorate his brother's Studio Building in Berkeley, which became the first home for the California School of Arts and Crafts (today's California College of the Arts) and the professional address of many prominent artists, including Henry Joseph Breuer and Evelyn Withrow. His many depictions of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire received great attention. He expanded his Berkeley gallery to maintain a permanent display of one of the three sets of his mission paintings and allowed the public to visit three days a week. He was a British citizen at the time of his death on May 11, 1923. Publications. 1966 saw the publication of "A Gallery of California Mission Paintings" by Edwin Deakin, edited by Ruth I. Mahood and produced by the staff of the History Division, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (W. Ritchie Press). The monograph "Edwin Deakin: California Painter of the Picturesque" by Scott A. Shields (Petaluma, CA: Pomegranate) was published in 2008 to coincide with a Deakin exhibit at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento.

Tamna, the Island () is a 2009 South Korean television series starring Seo Woo, Im Joo hwan and Pierre Deporte. It aired on MBC from August 8 to September 27, 2009 on Saturdays and Sundays at 19:55 for 20 episodes. It is a historical drama set in the 17th century during the European colonial expansion into the Far East. Themes of racial tension and xenophobia, social inequality, and rumination on the effect of foreign policy and international trade on the quotidien are prevalent throughout the series; however, the romantic comedy aspect remains at the forefront for the majority of the narrative. Synopsis. William J. Spencer (Pierre Deporte) is a young British aristocrat in the year 1640 with a fascination for East Asian art, languages, and culture. He counts as his closest friend the young somewhat mercenary Japanese merchantman Yan. William is swindled by a shady merchant into believing that a plain porcelain chamber pot is a mystical artifact; he then sails off to Nagasaki in order to open the "aquatic silk road" between Japan and England, but mostly to escape his creepy and overbearing mother and an arranged marriage. Yan is promised a handsome reward if he can drag her son back in time for the wedding and hightails it after his "friend." Meanwhile, the Joseon Kingdom is operating under a foreign policy that strictly prohibits trade with Westerners, garnering the nickname "the hermit kingdom." Just south of the Korean mainland lies the island of Jeju, which at this point in history is known as Tamra. The people who live on the island derive their livelihoods by diving for abalone, cultivating a large area of persimmon orchards, and basic subsistence farming; much of what they produce is tithed to the King through a corrupt local government. Park Gyu (Im Joo hwan) arrives from Hanyang (the historical name for Seoul) on a secret mission from the King to uncover corruption, embezzlement, and whatever else he may find on Tamra. However, his cover story leads to a tangle of complications for him: used to being doted on as an aristocratic scholar and high government official, he is sent to Tamra on the pretense of having been at the center of a sexual harassment scandal for which he has been permanently banished to the island, where he will have to work for a local family despite not being used to manual labor. Tamna native Jang Beo jin (Seo Woo) is an abalone diver whose mother is the leader of all the village divers ("haenyo" lit. "sea women"). Unfortunately for Beo jin, she didn't inherit her mother's gifts or prowess for diving. She is the lowest of the apprentice divers after eight years and she is constantly being berated by her mother and all the other divers; she manages to mess up every chance she is given. Her first meeting with Park Gyu comes when she is sent to deliver some abalone to the village elders for a religious ceremony but ends up knocking down the altar and Park Gyu, and losing the medallion that entitles her family to a lower tithe to the King. Believing it to be in Park Gyu's possession, she tries to get it back from the upright and uptight noble, who is later sent to live with Beo jin's family on the same day that William is shipwrecked off the coast; Beo jin hides him, and later Yan as well, in a cave outside the village. Production. The drama had been planned for 20 episodes (and filmed months in advance) but in its original run, MBC cut it down to 16 episodes due to low ratings despite fan fervor and general praise. As a result, beginning with episode 11, the production had to quickly edit down the remaining ten episodes into six, leaving a lot of material on the cutting room floor. The overseas broadcasts aired all 20 episodes, while the Director's Cut DVD release features 21 episodes.

The Medium Term Development Framework () (denoted as MTDF), is a policy measure programme of the Government of Pakistan drafted by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Coordination Committee and the Planning Commission of Pakistan, formulated to strengthen the national economy and civil infrastructure. Drafted and launched by former Prime minister Shaukat Aziz in 2005, the programme was envisioned to turn the country into a major industrialized nation, to increase the speed of human development and to sustain a new economic system which aimed to reduce poverty and achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The programme replaced the existing, centralized economic system of Pakistan, known as Five Year Plans which had been in effect since 1955. The programme emphasized principles of macroeconomics connected with the development of scientific technology and human resources, while guiding the formulation of policies in areas such as education, labor, trade, science and technology, taxation and financial management.

The programme can be traced back to early 2001, when the economic coordination committee working under Aziz began to research the development of a ten year programme and adopted the concept of three year rolling plans. The recommendations were prepared in the background of various economic sanctions imposed on Pakistan in 1998, until the economy began to recover in 2001. Finally, on June 1, 2004, the programme became part of official policy on March 5, 2005.

Montana State Highway 48 (MT 48) is a state highway in Deer Lodge County, Montana, United States. The highway is long, and connects MT 1 to Interstate 90, passing mainly through rural mining areas. MT 48 was first designated in 1938, although portions of a highway existed in the location of MT 48 by at least 1924. Route description. MT 48 begins at an intersection with MT 1 as a two lane, paved road. The highway proceeds northeastward through rural mining land for a short distance before intersecting S 273. The roadway continues northeast, running parallel to Warm Springs Creek. After a short distance, the highway passes Bowman Field and several small reservoirs that were created for mining. The road proceeds northeastward through more rural mining land before slightly bending eastward. The highway continues in a slight northeastward direction near the town of Warm Springs, crossing the Montana Western Railway.

Anemonoides apennina (syn. "Anemone apennina"), the Apennine anemone or blue anemone, is a rhizomatous perennial plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to southern central Europe, taking its name from the Apennine Mountains, but widely naturalised elsewhere in Europe, including the United Kingdom. It can be confused with "Anemonoides nemorosa" which it resembles. It grows to 20 cm. In early spring it produces single blue flowers above ferny foliage, which dies down in summer. The flowers are about 3.5 cm across, with 10 15 narrow petals. The leaves are palmate with dark green 3 lobed, toothed leaflets. The leaves are hairy underneath, which is how this plant may be distinguished from the similar "Anemone blanda". It is especially valued for its ability to colonise deciduous woodlands, but it is also found in open scrub, under park trees, and near former habitation. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Eating "A. apennina" may cause mild stomach upset, and contact with the skin may cause irritation.

Asigarh Fort, also called Hansi Fort is located on the eastern bank of "Amti lake" in Hansi town of Haryana, India, about 135 km from Delhi on NH9. Spread over 30 acres, in its prime days this fort used to be in control of 80 forts in the area around it. The fort is said to be one of the most impregnable forts of ancient India and has been declared a centrally protected monument by ASI in 1937. Etymology. Asigarh the fort of swords, from "Asi" (sword) and "garh" (fort), as this was the centre of sword making from the ancient times of Hindu rulers. There are several names used for the fort in different anecdotes, such as Asidurga, Asigarh, Asika, A sika, Ansi, Hansi, etc., History. Earlier Fort. Hansi fort or Asigarh Fort has long history with little clarity about the earlier period. The excavation of ancient coins belong to the BCE period shows that there have been long history of settlements on the mound on which fort is built. It is believed that original fort was built by the famous emperor Harshavardhana or his grandfather emperor Prabhakaravardhana of Pushyabhuti dynasty (Vardhana). The present fort was built with materials of earlier fort of 7th century C.E. Tomars Builder and first rulers of present Asigarh Fort. As per British library, Asigarh fort has been believed to have been founded by Anangpal Tomar (Anangpal II), the Tomar king of Delhi. The son of King Anangpal Tomar, Drupad established a sword manufacturing factory in this fort, hence it is also called "Asigarh". Swords from this fort were exported as far away as to Arab countries. As per "Talif e Tajkara e Hansi" by Qazi Sharif Husain in 1915, around 80 forts across the area were controlled from this centre "Asigarh". The Tomar Empire during the reign of Anangpal II extended over various parts of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. In addition to the Asigarh (Hansi), other important places of this dynasty were Sthaneshwar (Thanesar), Sonkh (Mathura), Taragarh, Gopachal(Gwalior), Tanwarhinda (Bhatinda), Tanwarghaar, Pathankot Nurpur, Patan Tanwarawati, Nagarkot (Kangra), Multiple (three) Tomara kings seem to have shared the name "Anangapala" (IAST: Ana gap la). Around 1000 CE, Asigarh, Haryana and Delhi were in control of emperors of Tomara dynasty, when in 1014 Mahmud Ghazni attacked Thanesar and Hansi where he mass destroyed Hindu temples, and again in 1025 he also attacked Somnath temple and Jat people of Jud. Mahmud Ghazni had sent his son Mas'ud I of Ghazni to attack Hansi in 1037 CE, when Masud attacked swordsmen of Hansi and took Hindu women into slavery who were later sold at Gazni. In 1041 in revenge for murder of his father, Mahmud Ghazni's nephew Mawdud of Ghazni (r. 1041 50 CE) seized the throne from his uncle Mahmud Ghazni. Kumarpal Tomar (or Mahipal Tomar) of Tomar dynasty who ruled this area from Delhi in the 11th century recaptured Hansi and Thanesar regions from Mawdud, and based on fragmentary Tomar inscriptions discovered from Mahipalpur in Delhi it has been theorized that Mahipala established a new capital at Mahipalapura (now Mahipalpur). Chauhan rule. According to the Bijolia inscription of Someshvara of Chauhan dynasty, his brother Vigraharaja IV had captured Dhillika (Delhi) and Ashika (Hansi). He probably defeated the Tomar king Anangapala III. Additions were made to the fort by Prithviraj Chauhan in the 12th century. Muslim rule. In 1192, after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan by Mohammed Gauri, Hindu rule ended in Hansi. Sikh and Maratha rule. In 1705, during the time of Aurangzeb, Guru Gobind Singh toured Hansi to inspired the people to revolt against the oppressive Mughal rule. In 1707, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur attacked Hansi. In 1736, the fort was under Maratha rule. In 1780s Maharaja Jassa Singh Ramgarhia also took this area under his control for some years as a Maratha vassal and then left. British colonial rule. From 1798 to 1801, George Thomas, an Irish immigrant who rose from an ordinary sailor, usurped the area around Hansi and made Asigarh fort his capital. In 1802 after the Anglo Maratha Wars, the British East India Company rule seized the fort, but did not take control until 1810 and after which they controlled it till independence of India in 1947. The fort was again built by George Thomas in 1798 when he carved out his own kingdom consisting of Hisar and Rohtak districts with capital at Hansi. In 1803 Hansi was also the headquarters of Colonel James Skinner CB (1778 4 December 1841) the Anglo Indian military adventurer in India, who founded 1st Skinner's Horse and 3rd Skinner's Horse at Hansi in 1803. These units are still part of the Indian Army. in 1818 was granted a "jagir" of Hansi (Hisar district, Haryana), yielding Rs 20,000 a year. Hansi took an active part in the Sepoy Mutiny (Gadar), Lala Hukam Chand Jain was martyred in 1857 by Britishers. British Indian Army built a cantonment in this fort after George Thomas surrendered to British Raj in 1803. During the revolt of 1857, the cantonment was abandoned and the fort was damaged. The prisoners of the Kuka movement were imprisoned in this fort during the 1880s. Fort Details. The fort is said to be one of the most impregnable forts of ancient India The walls of the fort are high and thick. At the south end of the fort is a big gate added later by George Thomas. The carvings on the walls assign it to be of Hindu origin. Main gate. The main gate has the beautiful carvings of birds, animals and Hindu deities. An inscription there says it was repaired by Alauddin Khilji in 1304. Baradari. Long pillared structure with a flat roof is situated on the top of the mound and is known as Baradari. Char Qutub Dargah. A mosque is also located inside the fort complex which was added after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan. Excavations. The ancient coins of the period before Christ were found here. 57 bronze images of Jain thirthankars were found during excavation in the fort. A statue of the Buddha was excavated here. In February 1982, a large hoard known as Hansi hoard of Jaina bronzes including idols belonging to the Gupta period (319 to 605 CE) and 7th 8th centuries (a period belonging to the emperor Harshavardhana's Pushyabhuti dynasty, c. 500 to 647 CE) were discovered.
Protostropharia semiglobata, commonly known as the dung roundhead, the halfglobe mushroom, or the hemispheric stropharia, is an agaric fungus of the family Strophariaceae. A common and widespread species with a cosmopolitan distribution, the fungus produces mushrooms on the dung of various wild and domesticated herbivores. The mushrooms have hemispherical straw yellow to buff tan caps measuring , greyish gills that become dark brown in age, and a slender, smooth stem long with a fragile ring. Taxonomy. The species was first described as "Agaricus semiglobatus" by August Batsch in 1786. It has had a complicated taxonomic history, having been shuffled to many different genera. In addition to "Agaricus" the species has been placed in "Coprinus", "Geophila", "Psalliota", and "Psilocybe". French mycologist Lucien Qu let gave it its most commonly used name in 1872 when he transferred it to "Stropharia". In 2013, Scott Redhead made it the type species of "Protostropharia", a new genus circumscribed to contain "Stropharia" species characterized by the formation of astrocystidia rather than acanthocytes on their mycelium. A form "sterilis" and two varieties, "minor" and "radicata", described by F.H. M ller in 1945, are no longer considered to have independent taxonomic significance. The specific epithet "semiglobata" is Latin for "half spherical", and refers to the shape of the cap. It is commonly known as the halfglobe mushroom, the hemispheric stropharia, the round stropharia, or the dung roundhead. Description. The cap is obtuse to hemispherical in shape, reaching a diameter of . The cap surface is smooth and sticky, and initially has a light yellow color that fades in maturity to dull yellow or whitish. The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem with a slight decurrent tooth. They are distantly spaced and broad about 6 8 mm; mature gills become ventricose (swollen). The gills are initially grayish, but become purplish brown to dark purple as the spores mature. The edges of the gills are white and fringed. The stem is long by thick, with a bulbous base. Initially filled with a cottony pith, the stem becomes hollow in maturity. A delicate ring forms an annular zone on the mid to upper portion of the stem that may be darkened from spore deposits. Above the annular zone, the stem is covered with fine silk like hairs; below, it is sticky. The stem tissue is white with a yellowish pith. The flesh has no distinctive odor, and a taste that is mild to slightly bitter. The fruit bodies have been listed as edible by some authors, but poisonous by others; even when not toxic, mushrooms that grow on dung are usually considered unpalatable, though the common mushroom is an obvious counter example. The mushroom produce a dark purple spore print. The thick walled spores are ellipsoidal, smooth, and have a small apical germ pore; they measure 16.1 19.0 by 8.8 11.0 m. The basidia (spore bearing cells) are four spored, club shaped, hyaline (translucent), and measure 33 40 by 13 14.6 m. Similar species. Other mushrooms that resemble "Protostropharia semiglobosa" include "Stropharia dorsispora", "S. luteonitens", and "Panaeolus semiovatus". Habitat and distribution. A saprobic species, the fungus fruits in small groups on dung, in soil containing manure, on lawns, grasslands, or in livestock corrals. It has been recorded on the dung of a variety of wild and domesticated herbivores and ungulates, including rabbit, sheep, cow, buffalo, moose, bear, and wallaby. In some instances, the dung substrate is under moss so that it appears as if the mushroom is growing from the moss. Fruits bodies sometimes occur with another dung loving fungus, "Deconica coprophila". A widespread and common species, "P. semiglobosa" has a cosmopolitan distribution, having been recorded from northern Asia, Australia, Europe, Central and South America, North America, North Africa, and New Zealand. It is thought to have been introduced to Australia with imported domestic stock.

Qingdao Amerasia International School (QAIS) is a private, non profit international school located in Qingdao, China, offering Montessori education from ages 1.5 5 and an inquiry based curriculum up to age 18. QAIS has over 200 enrolled students representing 25 countries. Qingdao Amerasia International School is an International Baccalaureate World School, offering the full IB Continuum: the IB Primary Years Programme, IB Middle Years Programme, and IB Diploma Programme. Their Montessori Toddler and Montessori Early Childhood Programs are the only programs in Asia to be accredited by the American Montessori Society. The language of instruction is English with Mandarin Chinese as an additional language taught daily. QAIS History. Qingdao Amerasia International School began its first classes on September 4, 2006 as Qingdao American International School. This new school was the result of the rapidly growing foreign community in Qingdao and the need for a learning environment that provided a solid education comparable to a typical American K 12 school. In August 2011, the school became licensed by the Chinese Government as an International School #110, and re opened with a new philosophy of international mindedness, as well as a new name Qingdao Amerasia International School. Curriculum. QAIS curriculum follows both IB and Montessori programmes of study. Montessori Toddler (18 months 3 years) The Toddler program, for children 18 months and up, takes advantage of the toddler's natural drive to act independently. The QAIS Montessori Children's House is a Montessori Toddler Program, focused on preparing an environment that supports the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of each child. The children are given opportunities to work individually and cooperatively in a group setting. They learn to verbally express themselves as they explore self, family, and the world in which they live. This helps the children move consciously in the world. Toddlers spend the year becoming comfortable in their classroom community, gaining confidence in themselves, developing an awareness of others, and learning to feel secure in the relaxed atmosphere of our school setting. Toddlers are in a developmental stage that Maria Montessori called a period of unconscious absorbent creation. In the Toddler's process of embodying the world, adults influence attitudes, characteristics, personality traits, speech habits, mannerisms, and how children come to think about themselves and the world at large. Adults prepare the Toddler's environment with enriching aesthetics, materials, and furniture in order to foster independence and nurture curiosity. The members of our Toddler staff are Montessori certified, as well as loving adults who contribute and facilitating the development of our future generations. The classrooms are a special place for the young child to begin his/her steps towards independence and self reliance. The safe, loving, gentle atmosphere puts children and parents at ease and makes for a trusting, spontaneous transition to school. Toddlers come to school five days a week, and may choose to stay for mornings only or a full day. The Toddler Program is where the children begin to cultivate an interest in learning and a desire for exploration. The Toddlers learn concentration, coordination, language skills, responsibility, and respect all. Toddler exercises and activities recognize that children learn by doing. Classroom materials are always accessible, attractive, safe, and geared for a child's success. Activities are changed regularly in response to children's need for variety and challenge as they grow and learn. The toddler Montessori classroom emphasizes specific skills, but there is dynamic interplay among the areas, enhancing children's natural learning process. Montesori Early Childhood (Ages 3 6) In the Early Childhood classes at Qingdao Amerasia International School, the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme combines with the Montessori educational environment to reinforce connections between students' personal world and the global community in which they live. In QAIS established Montessori/PYP class for 3 6 year olds, there are no timetables to regiment activities or a fixed syllabus to cramp the expansion of the mind. Here, in an orderly atmosphere of freedom, the children work independently at chosen tasks, working at their own pace and rhythm for as long as they wish in order to fulfill their needs. From the foundation of sensorial experiences, the child builds his mind in the world of abstract ideas. The Early Childhood years are filled with a wide range of didactic materials. The whole world of culture embracing subject areas, such as geography, history, science, music, art, language and mathematics is open to the child. These early experiences will form a foundation for the wide fields of inquiry and research during the 6 12 years. The Montessori/PYP Early Childhood course of study includes: Practical Life, Sensorial, Language, Mathematics, Cultural Studies. In addition, music, art, physical education, and library will round out the Early Childhood curriculum. A Montessori Early Childhood Student at QAIS works on his Sensorial Skills. IB Primary Years Program (Grades 1 through 6) QAIS believes that by the age of 6 or 7, children's emerging powers of reason and imagination enable them to explore and discover on an abstract level. Therefore, children are encouraged to research the answers to their own questions. Their research is not limited to the classroom, but also includes opportunities for going out on field trips to the library, bank, stores, beach, offices, etc. They develop a better understanding of human life through this direct experience and begin to better appreciate the community in which they live. The IB Primary Years Program is divided into six transdisciplinary themes: Who we are, How we organize ourselves, Where we are in place and time, Sharing the planet, How we express ourselves, How the world works. Through these six themes, students will explore the following subject areas: geography, history, biology, English language and literature, Mandarin Chinese language and culture, mathematics (including elements of algebra and geometry), science (including principles of physics and chemistry), and library science. The entire curriculum is integrated, meaning that all subjects are viewed as related. For example, when students study Africa in world history, they might also read African folk tales in world literature, create African masks in art, sing Swahili songs in music, make hieroglyphic calendars in math, and study African animals in zoology. The Primary Years Programme grades 1 6 course of study includes: Reading, Writing, Word Study, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Chinese, Music, Art, Drama, Violin/Band (Grades 3 6), and Physical Education. At QAIS, homework is viewed as an extension of their work at school. Typically homework involves some reading, math, research, and writing. The elementary program also includes physical education, computer technology, Mandarin, music, fine arts, practical life and social skills, community service and drama. IB Middle Years Programme/ IB Diploma Years Programme (Grades 7 12) Between ages 12 18, children enter their adolescence and begin to construct their Social Self. Students place a great emphasis on relationships and strive to find their place in society. This period of development is characterized by self concern and self assessment, as well as critical thinking and re evaluation. Children experience both profound physical changes and complex mental changes. An academic program that allows students to construct their social and moral values through the core subject areas is viewed to be the most engaging for students of this age group. Cultural development, which has been ongoing since birth, is solidified in this plane. Cooperative learning, inquiry based group projects, and portfolio and performance based assessments yield the most positive results with this age group while they navigate through a deeper understanding of math, science, technology, language, history, PE, art, and music. Community and service projects help students of this age group to develop compassion and to see the world as interconnected.

Maurice Vidal Portman (21 March 1860 14 February 1935) was a British naval officer, who is best known for documenting several Andamanese tribes between 1879 and 1901 when he was posted as a superintendent of the Andaman Island Penal Colony. Life and career. Portman was born in Canada, the third son of Maurice Berkeley Portman and to Helen Vidal Harris. His father was in turn the third son of Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman, and Emma Portman, Baroness Portman. He joined the Royal Indian Marine at the age of 16 and was some time in charge of the Viceroy's yacht. In July 1879 he was stationed at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands and made Officer in Charge of the Andamanese, a post which he held for more than 20 years with few interruptions (including December 1880 to December 1883 on sick leave, March 1887 to March 1888 on furlough). Port Blair. During his time as a colonial administrator at Port Blair, Portman took a large number of photographs of the Andamanese, including some at the request of British Museum (at his own expense) and the Government of India (on payment). Portman also undertook an expedition to North Sentinel Island to contact the previously uncontacted tribe inhabiting the island. During the expedition, the Sentinelese fled at the sight of the expedition, though his party captured two adults and four children, taking them to the capital of the South Andaman Island, Port Blair. The adults died of illness soon after reaching Port Blair, and Portman ordered the children to be sent back with a large quantity of gifts after a few weeks. The illness carried by the returning children, who had acquired them in Port Blair, has been suggested by some as the cause of the hostility displayed by the Sentinelese towards outsiders. During his time as a colonial administrator, Portman noted the devastating impact outside diseases, such as smallpox, had on the Andamanese. Portman continued to take photographs of the Andamanese in Port Blair until the end of his stay in the island, documenting information about their anthropological details, showing a marked interest in measuring the phalluses of the Andamanese. A significant portion of his photography involved posing the Andamanese in mock Greek homoerotic compositions. Portman repeatedly praised the male Andamanese body, writing that "many of the men are very good looking; as they have none of the thick lips, high cheekbones, and flat noses of the negro type; though the women are rather of the Hottentot Venus order of beauty". The plates made by Portman are now scattered among several museums around the world and may be partly unpublished. He also wrote two books, "Notes of the Languages of the South Andaman Group of Languages" (1898) and "A History of Our Relations with the Andamanese" (1899). Portman also composed a significant collection of ethnographic objects during his time on the Andaman Islands that are now in the collections of the British Museum. Later life. His obituary stated that he had a "frail physique" and suffered from ill health. After retiring as an invalid in 1901, he went back to Britain where he did some journalism and "some valuable Secret Service work" during World War I. He was a member of the Union Club. He never married and left no descendants.

Isaak Soreau (1604 in Frankfurt 1644 in Frankfurt), was a German Baroque painter. Biography. According to the RKD he was the son of the painter Daniel Soreau, and the twin brother of Peter, who went to live in Amsterdam on the Herengracht, where he became engaged on 17 April 1677, aged 31, to Louysa Eygels. His witness was his mother Constantia Hochepied. His works are strongly reminiscent of the painter Jacob van Hulsdonck, leading historians to believe that he must have worked for him in his workshop in Antwerp at some point, though this as yet has not been firmly documented, and it is more likely that he was taught by Georg Flegel during his Frankfurt years, whose works have been attributed in the past to Osias Beert. Soreau, the son of an Antwerp painter in Frankfurt, specialized in "table top still lifes," featuring fruits, flowers, and insects. An Isaak Soreau was regent of the Nieuwe Zijds Huiszitten almshouse of Amsterdam in 1681.

Nowaki ( "Nowaki") is a short Japanese novel by Natsume S seki (1867 1916). Written in 1907, the novel was published in the magazine "Hototogisu" in January. The year 1907 was a turning point in the author's life when he left his Tokyo University teaching position to write full time for the daily Asahi Shimbun. He also serialized the novel "Gubijins " ( ) the same year. Plot. "Nowaki" is about three men, all of whom are writers. Two of the younger men, the tubercular Takayanagi and the dandy Nakano, were close in their student days, and are now recent university graduates making their way in the world. The older man of the three is known as D ya sensei (Master D ya), once a teacher in the provinces who was forced to leave his post by villagers and students angered over his disrespectful attitude toward wealth and authority, now pursuing in Tokyo a career as an editor and writer, but barely eking out a livelihood, much to his wife's consternation. Magazine editor by day, he longs to finish and publish his more serious writing, "Essay on Character." By sheer coincidence, the three lives come together over the sum of one hundred yen (about a month's salary at the time): Nakano's gift to Takayanagi to convalesce at a seaside hot springs, D ya sensei's debts which are paid off with the purchase of his manuscript, and Takayangi's act of self sacrifice and redemption. Criticism. Thematically, "Nowaki" is linked to "The Two Hundred Tenth Day" ( "Nihyaku t ka"), the short, lightweight work it follows, and to "Gubijins ", an overwrought melodramatic tragedy of a young woman unable to succeed in a man's world. "Nowaki" and "Gubijins " are the most moralistic and didactic of S seki's works of fiction, but they also received public and critical acclaim. "Nowaki" has much in common with Mori gai's short story "Youth" ( "Seinen"), in which S seki appears as a character named Hirata Fuseki, who lectures on literature and intellectual life. Modern tastes may find "Nowaki" contrived, but it was considered by some to be the best novel of 1907. Jim Reichert's analysis of the text can be found in "The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name: Male Male Desire in Natsume S seki's "Nowaki," in his book "In the Company of Men: Representations of Male Male Sexuality in Meiji Literature". Angela Yiu has a chapter on "Nowaki" in her book "Chaos and Order in the Works of Natsume S seki."

Wilburn Hill King (June 10, 1839 December 12, 1910) was a Confederate States Army colonel during the American Civil War (Civil War). He was assigned to duty as a brigadier general by General E. Kirby Smith but he was not officially appointed and confirmed to that grade. King had been a lawyer and businessman in Warrensburg, Missouri at the outbreak of the Civil War. He promptly enlisted in the pro Confederate Missouri State Guard. After being wounded at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, he was discharged and returned to Texas. There he enlisted as a private in the 18th Texas Infantry Regiment. In October 1861, he served as major and quartermaster of the division of Texas regiments which was being formed at that time. On May 13, 1862, he was elected major of the regiment. He progressed to lieutenant colonel and colonel in 1863. On April 8, 1864, King's regiment, as part of Major General John G. Walker's division, helped rout three Union Army divisions at the Battle of Mansfield, where he was severely wounded. On April 16, 1864, General E. Kirby Smith, as the Confederate commander of the Trans Mississippi Department, assigned King to duty as a brigadier general. The Confederate government took no action on the appointment and Confederate President Jefferson Davis did not officially appoint and nominate King to the rank of brigadier general. By the end of the war, King had acted as a general officer, leading brigades, and briefly Walker's division, for more than a year, but had not been legally promoted to a general officer's grade. After fleeing to Mexico at the end of the war, and then operating a sugar plantation in Central America, King returned to Texas where he practiced law, was the mayor of Sulphur Springs, Texas, was a state representative and was Adjutant General of Texas from 1881 to 1891. After he retired as adjutant general, he concentrated on the affairs of the Masonic Order. Early life. Wilburn Hill King was born in Culloden, Georgia on June 10, 1839. His parents were Alexander and Mary (Douglas) King. King studied law and medicine at Americus, Georgia. He was a lawyer, prospector and businessman. He moved to Cass County, Texas in 1860 but he was in business at Warrensburg, Missouri when the Civil War began. King married Lucy Furman in 1867. American Civil War service. Wilburn Hill King, like another Missouri officer with a similar career, Benjamin Franklin Gordon, was an early enlistee in the pro Confederate Missouri State Guard. King was elected lieutenant of Company E of the 3rd Infantry Regiment under Major General Sterling Price. He progressed to captain and fought at the Battle of Carthage and the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861, where, like Gordon, he was wounded. Soon thereafter, he was discharged from the regiment and returned to Texas where he enlisted as a private in the 18th Texas Infantry Regiment. Two historians say he was appointed major and quartermaster of the Texas Division being organized by Brigadier General Henry E. McCulloch and later commanded by Major General John G. Walker on October 15, 1861. King was elected major of the 18th Texas Infantry on May 13, 1862, lieutenant colonel on February 5, 1863 and colonel to rank from August 10, 1863. The 18th Texas Infantry was assigned to Brigade 1 in Major General John G. Walker's division. The 18th Texas Infantry was detached from Walker's division in the fall of 1863 and temporarily assigned to a cavalry division under Major General Thomas Green. On November 3, 1863, King led the regiment under Green in a successful attack on a Union Army detachment at the Battle of Bayou Bourbeau. King's regiment was recalled to Walker's division in time for the Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana on April 8, 1864. King's regiment helped rout three Union Army divisions. King was severely wounded at the end of the attack. On April 16, 1864, General E. Kirby Smith, as commander of the Trans Mississippi Department, assigned King to command as a brigadier general. Smith intended that King take command of the brigade formerly commanded by Major General Camille de Polignac. King could not assume this command until he had recovered from his wound in October 1864. According to Allardice, in February 1865, King assumed command of a new Brigade 4 in Walker's old division. Eicher and Blessington show King in command of Brigade 4, a brigade of Texas regiments, in Polignac's division from September 1864 or October 8, 1864, respectively King's appointment as a brigadier general by E. Kirby Smith remained unconfirmed at the end of the war. Although King had served in general officer commands for more than a year, he was never appointed or legally promoted to general officer rank by Jefferson Davis. Aftermath and death. After E. Kirby Smith's surrender of the Confederate Trans Mississippi Department, King, like Benjamin Franklin Gordon and Brigadier General Jo Shelby, went to Mexico. He then bought and operated a sugar plantation in Central America for a brief time. King returned briefly to the United States and married Lucy Furman in December 1867. The couple then soon left for King's Central America plantation. King returned to Texas to practice law less than a year later, after the deaths of his wife and infant. In 1875, King became mayor of Sulphur Springs, Texas. He was a state representative from 1878 to 1881. King served as adjutant general of the State of Texas from 1881 to 1891. In 1891, he retired to Sulphur Springs where he worked on the affairs of the Masonic Order. Wilburn Hill King died at Sulphur Springs, Texas on December 12, 1910. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Corsicana, Texas after Methodist funeral rites and a Masonic burial.

Terminalia richii, with the common name malili, is an upright forest tree species native to the central South Pacific in Oceania. The wood grown on this tree can be used mainly for construction and timber, and for other numerous purposes. Description. Mature "Terminalia richii" trees are usually tall and upright. The species is usually distinguished from other trees because it emerges from the rainforest canopies with a height ranging from . Its leaves have a dark green color on top and have a lighter green coloration underneath. The leaves are affixed to the tips of the branches. In fact, the genus name "Terminalia" comes from the Latin word "terminus", which refers to the leaves appearing at the furthest tips of the shoots. Also, the leaves is what makes Malili distinguishable from other trees that are very similar to it. The leaves of Malili are generally smaller and narrower with a lanceolate shape. The bark of Malili is gray and is usually covered with mosses and lichens. The seeds of this tree are usually covered with a fleshy layer. A mature tree is rather large and can grow up to . Flowers and fruit. Flowers of "Terminalia richii" are generally a blend of yellow and white and are located at the end of the branches. They are arranged in clusters of axillary spikes. Malili flowers are also five lobed and consist of ten anthers. Flowering in Malili usually occur from September and continue to January. Flowering and fruiting are poor in Malili because of the environmental conditions in which they live in. Common cyclones in the Samoan archipelago damage the fruits and flowers in these trees. Maturation of the fruit of "Terminalia richii" varies depending on the location of the tree. The lower the altitude of the tree, the faster the fruit ripens. Mature fruits bear a reddish purple color. Fruits are usually located at the top of the tree and are usually collected by climbing the tree or using other proper equipment. Fruit are not eaten by humans, but is a good source of food for birds like pigeons, doves and manumea (an endangered bird in Samoa). The fruit is usually removed before collecting and using the seeds. Distribution. Malili ("Terminalia richii") is an endangered species found in the lowland areas and lower montane forests of the Samoan archipelago. It can grow in a variety of elevations from . Malili is native to the Pacific islands of Samoa and American Samoa. In addition, the tree was also found in the central South Pacific island of Niue, but is now extinct in the wild and in recent years has been reintroduced in trial wood lots. Malili was not very frequent in Samoa to begin with. Because of agricultural activities and numerous cyclones, the population of Malili has declined dramatically, making it endangered. Numbers have decreased the most in Upolu, an island in the Samoan archipelago. It grows in a variety of elevations but is usually found in both lower montane forests and lowland tropical rainforests. Habitat and ecology. "Terminalia richii" is adapted to maritime, moist/humid and tropical climates. Its native habitat experiences a precipitation zone that ranges from per year or more, mostly during the summer. The annual temperature of its habitat ranges from . Malili grows in fertile and well drained soil. It prefers soil that originates from volcanic activity, or basaltic soil. The soil is also usually heavy textured. Malili protrudes from the canopy of rainforests because it grows best under high and intense amount of sunlight. Because of this requirement, Malili has a very low potential to become an invasive plant. Malili does interact with other species and depends on them for its reproduction. Species of birds including pigeons, doves and bats are pollinators of Malili and are also used for seed dispersal. Uses. "Terminalia richii" have a wide range of usage, from timber to construction. Malili is popularly used for building canoes. Timber from this tree is used for construction of buildings. The timber is light with a density of per square meter. In addition to constructing buildings, the timber is also used for paneling and building furniture for houses. Although its timber is very useful, usage is very limited now due to the fact that the tree is now endangered. In addition, Malili is a preferable tree to use for its timber because of its fast initial growth and a higher resistance to cyclones compared to the rest of the plantation in Samoa. The fruit of the tree is attractive to pigeons, and it is sometimes used for pigeon hunting. Conservation. The lowland forests of Samoa are damaged and degraded because of a dramatic increase in agricultural activity and deforestation. In addition, regular occurring cyclones also add to the destruction of the forests. Thirdly, the native vine "Merremia peltata" (which has become an invasive species in other areas) has interfered with the regeneration of the forestry. The vine does this by basically strangling the vegetation. Since "Terminalia richii" is popular for its timber, it should be conserved and sustained to prevent complete extinction. "Terminalia richii" can be propagated from seed and by root cuttings. However, production of seeds in mature trees will be hindered because of cyclones. Also, Malili has a relatively low germination rate of less than 50%. Therefore, the usage of both seeds and root cuttings together is more effective in propagating the plant for restoration projects. Another tree species, "Mailkara samoensis", is popular for its timber and is also endangered along with Malili.
English determiners (also known as determinatives) are words such as "the", "a", "each", "some", "which", "this", and "six" that are most commonly used with nouns to specify their referents. The determiners form a closed lexical category in English. The syntactic role characteristically performed by determiners is known as the determinative function (see ). A determinative combines with a noun (or, more formally, a nominal; see ) to form a noun phrase (NP). This function typically comes before any modifiers in the NP (e.g., "some very pretty wool sweaters", not "*very pretty some wool sweaters"). The determinative function is typically obligatory in a singular, countable, common noun phrase (compare "I have a new cat" to *"I have new cat"). Semantically, determiners are usually definite or indefinite (e.g., "the cat" versus "a cat"), and they often agree with the number of the head noun (e.g., "a new cat" but not *"many new cat"). Morphologically, they are usually simple and do not inflect. The most common of these are the definite and indefinite articles, "the" and "a"("n"). Other determiners in English include the demonstratives "this" and "that", and the quantifiers (e.g., "all", "many", and "none") as well as the numerals. Determiners also occasionally function as modifiers in noun phrases (e.g., "the many changes"), determiner phrases (e.g., "many more") or in adjective or adverb phrases (e.g., "not that big"). They may appear on their own without a noun, similar to pronouns (e.g., "I'll have some"), but they are distinct from pronouns. Terminology. Words and phrases can be categorized by both their syntactic category and their syntactic function. In the clause "the dog bit the man", for example, "the dog" belongs to the syntactic category of noun phrase and performs the syntactic function of subject. The distinction between category and function is at the heart of a terminological issue surrounding the word "determiner": various grammars have used the word to describe a category, a function, or both. Some sources, such as "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language", use determiner as a term for a category as defined above and "determinative" for the function that determiners and possessives typically perform in a noun phrase (see ). Others, such as "The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language" ("CGEL"), make the opposite terminological choice. And still others (e.g., "The Grammar Book") use determiner for both the category and the function. This article uses "determiner" for the category and "determinative" for the function in the noun phrase. The lexical category determiner is the class of words described in this article. They head determiner phrases, which can realize the functions determinative, predeterminative, and modifier: The syntactic function determinative is a function that specifies a noun phrase. That is, determinatives add abstract meanings to the noun phrase, such as definiteness, proximity, number, and the like. While the determinative function is typically realized by determiner phrases, they may also be realized by noun phrases and prepositional phrases: This article is about determiners as a lexical category. History. Traditional grammar has no concept to match determiners. Traditionally these words have been classified as adjectives, articles, and pronouns. The articles and demonstratives have sometimes been seen as forming their own category, but they too have often been classified as adjectives. Indeed, linguist and historian Peter Matthews observes that the assumption that determiners are distinct from adjectives is relatively new, "an innovation of the early 1960s." In 1892, prior to the emergence of the determiner category in English grammars, Leon Kellner discussed the idea of "determination" of a noun: In Old English the possessive pronoun, or, as the French say, "pronominal adjective," expresses only the conception of belonging and possession; it is a real adjective, and does not convey, as at present, the idea of determination. If, therefore, Old English authors want to make nouns preceded by possessive pronouns determinative, they add the definite article. By 1924, Harold Palmer had proposed a part of speech called "Pronouns and Determinatives", effectively "group[ing] with the pronouns all determinative adjectives (e.g., article like, demonstratives, possessives, numerals, etc.), [and] shortening the term to determinatives (the "d terminatifs" of the French grammarians)." Palmer separated this category from more prototypical adjectives (what he calls "qualificative adjectives") because, unlike prototypical adjectives, words in this category are not used predicatively, tend not to inflect for comparison, and tend not to be modified. In 1933, Leonard Bloomfield introduced the term determiner used in this article, which appears to define a syntactic function performed by "limiting adjectives". Our limiting adjectives fall into two sub classes of determiners and numeratives The determiners are defined by the fact that certain types of noun expressions (such as "house" or "big house") are always accompanied by a determiner (as, "this house", "a big house"). Matthews argues that the next important contribution was by Ralph B. Long in 1961, though Matthews notes that Long's contribution is largely ignored in the bibliographies of later prominent grammars, including "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" and "CGEL". Matthews illustrates Long's analysis with the noun phrase "this boy": ""this" is no longer, in [Long's] account, an adjective. It is instead a pronoun, of a class he called determinative', and it has the function of a determinative modifier'." This analysis was developed in a 1962 grammar by Barbara M. H. Strang and in 1972 by Randolph Quirk and colleagues. In 1985, "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" appears to have been the first work to explicitly conceive of determiner as a distinct lexical category. Determiners as heads? Until the late 1980s, linguists assumed that, in a phrase like "the red ball", the head was the noun "ball" and that "the" was a dependent. But a student at MIT named Paul Abney proposed, in his PhD dissertation about English noun phrases (NPs) in 1987, that the head was not the noun "ball" but the determiner "the", so that "the red ball" is a determiner phrase (DP). This has come to be known as the DP analysis or the DP hypothesis (see Determiner phrase), and it is the majority view in generative grammar today, though it is rejected in other perspectives. Determiners versus other lexical categories. Adjectives. The main similarity between adjectives and determiners is that they can both appear immediately before nouns (e.g., "many"/"happy people"). The key difference between adjectives and determiners in English is that adjectives cannot function as determinatives. The determinative function is an element in NPs that is obligatory in most singular countable NPs and typically occurs before any modifiers (see ). For example, "*I live in small house" is ungrammatical because "small house" is a singular countable NP lacking a determinative. The adjective "small" is a modifier, not a determinative. In contrast, if the adjective is replaced or preceded by a possessive NP ("I live in my house") or a determiner ("I live in that small house"), then it becomes grammatical because possessive NPs and determiners function as determinatives. There are a variety of other differences between the categories. Determiners appear in partitive constructions, while adjectives do not (e.g., "some of the people" but not "*happy of the people"). Adjectives can function as a predicative complement in a verb phrase (e.g., "that was lovely"), but determiners typically cannot (e.g., "*that was every"). Adjectives are not typically definite or indefinite, while determiners are. Adjectives as modifiers in a noun phrase do not need to agree in number with a head noun (e.g., "old book", "old books") while determiners do (e.g., "this book", "these books"). Morphologically, adjectives often inflect for grade (e.g., "big", "bigger", "biggest"), while few determiners do. Finally, adjectives can typically form adverbs by adding " ly" (e.g., "cheap" "cheaply"), while determiners cannot. The boundary between determiner and adjective is not always clear, however. In the case of the word "many", for example, the distinction between determiner and adjective is fuzzy, and different linguists and grammarians have placed this term into different categories. "The CGEL" categorizes "many" as a determiner because it can appear in partitive constructions, as in "many of them". Alternatively, Bas Aarts offers three reasons to support the analysis of "many" as an adjective. First, it can be modified by "very" (as in "his very many sins"), which is a characteristic typical of certain adjectives but not of determiners. Second, it can occur as a predicative complement: "his sins are many". Third, "many" has a comparative and superlative form ("more" and "most", respectively). Pronouns. Possessive pronouns such as "my" and "your". There is disagreement about whether possessive words such as "my" and "your" are determiners or not. For example, "Collins COBUILD Grammar" classifies them as determiners while "CGEL" classify them as pronouns and "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" has them dually classified as determiners"" and as pronouns in determinative function."" The main reason for classifying these possessive words as determiners is that, like determiners, they usually function as determinative in an NP (e.g., "my" / "the cat"). Reasons for calling them pronouns and not determiners include that the pronouns typically inflect (e.g., "I, me, my, mine, myself"), while determiners typically allow no morphological change. Determiners also appear in partitive constructions, while pronouns do not (e.g., "some of the people" but not "*my of the people"). Also, some determiners can be modified by adverbs (e.g., "very many"), but this is not possible for pronouns. "We" / "us" and "you". The words "you" and "we" share features commonly associated with both determiners and pronouns in constructions such as "we teachers do not get paid enough". On the one hand, the phrase initial position of these words is a characteristic they share with determiners (compare "the teachers"). Furthermore, they cannot combine with more prototypical determiners (*"the we teachers"), which suggests that they fill the same role. These characteristics have led linguists and grammarians like Ray Jackendoff and Steven Paul Abney to categorize such uses of "we" and "you" as determiners. On the other hand, these words can show case contrast (e.g., "us teachers"), a feature that, in Modern English, is typical of pronouns but not of determiners. Thus, Evelyne Delorme and Ray C. Dougherty treat words like "us" as pronouns in apposition with the noun phrases that follow them, an analysis that "Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage" also follows. Richard Hudson and Mariangela Spinillo also categorize these words as pronouns but without assuming an appositive relationship between the pronoun and the rest of the noun phrase. Adverbs. There is disagreement about whether "that" is a determiner or adverb in clauses like "it is not that unusual". For example, "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" categorizes this use of "that" as an adverb. This analysis is supported by the fact that other pre head modifiers of adjectives that "amplify" their meaning tend to be adverbs, such as "awfully" in "awfully sorry" and "too" in "too bright". On the other hand, Aarts categorizes this word as a determiner, a categorization also used in "CGEL". This analysis can be supported by expanding the determiner phrase: "it is not all that unusual". "All" can function as a premodifier of determiners (e.g., "all that cake") but not adjectives (e.g., *"all unusual"), which suggests that "that" is a determiner. Various quantificational expressions. Expressions with similar quantification meanings such as "a lot of", "lots of", "plenty of", "a great deal of", "tons of", etc. are sometimes said to be determiners, while other grammars argue that they are not words, or even phrases. The non determiner analysis is that they consist of the first part of a noun phrase. For example, "a lot of work" is a noun phrases with "lot" as its head. It has a preposition phrase complement beginning with the preposition "of". In this view, they could be considered lexicographical units, but they are not syntactic constituents. The syntax of determiners and determiner phrases. "For the sake of this section, Abney's DP hypothesis" (see ) "is set aside. In other words, here a DP is taken to be a dependent in a noun phrase (NP) and not the other way around." Internal structure. A determiner phrase (DP) is headed by a determiner and optionally takes dependents. DPs can take modifiers, which are usually adverb phrases (e.g., ["almost no"] "people") or determiner phrases (e.g., ["many more"] "people") . Comparative determiners like "fewer" or "more" can take "than" prepositional phrase (PP) complements (e.g., "it weighs" ["less than five"] "grams"). The following tree diagram in the style of "CGEL" shows the DP "far fewer than twenty", with the adverb "far" as a modifier and the PP "than twenty" as a complement. Functions. Determinative. As stated above, there is some terminological confusion about the terms "determiner" and "determinative". In this article, "determiner" is a lexical category while "determinative" is the function most typically performed by determiner phrases (in the same way that "adjective" denotes a category of words while "modifier" denotes the most typical function of adjective phrases). DPs are not the only phrases that can function as determinative, but they are the most common. A determinative is a function only in noun phrases. It is usually the leftmost constituent in the phrase, appearing before any modifiers. A noun phrase may have many modifiers, but only one determinative is possible. In most cases, a singular, countable, common noun requires a determinative to form a noun phrase, plurals and uncountables do not. The determinative is underlined in the following examples: The most common function of a DP is determinative in an NP. This is shown in the following syntax tree in the style of "CGEL". It features two determiner phrases, "all" in predeterminer modifier function (see ), and "the" in determinative function (labeled Det:DP). Predeterminative. If noun phrases can only contain one determinative, the following noun phrases present challenges: The determiner phrase "the" functions as the determinative in "all the time", and "those" functions as the determinative in "both those cars". But "all" and "both" also have specifying roles rather than modifying roles in the noun phrase, much like the determinatives do. To account for noun phrases like these, "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" also recognizes the function of predeterminative (or predeterminer). Some linguists and grammarians offer different accounts of these constructions. "CGEL", for instance, classifies them as a kind of modifier in noun phrases. Predeterminatives are typically realized by determiner phrases (e.g., "all" in "all the time"). However, they can also be realized by noun phrases (e.g., "one fifth the size") and adverb phrases ("e.g., thrice the rate"). Modifier. Determiner phrases can function as pre head modifiers in noun phrases, adjective phrases, and adverb phrases. They can function as pre head modifiers in noun phrases, such as the determiner phrase "two" in "these two images". In this example, "these" functions as the determinative of the noun phrase, and "two" functions as a modifier of the head "images". Determiner phrases can also function as pre head modifiers in adjective phrases [AdjP [DP "the"] "more"]"," [AdjP [DP "the"] "merrier"] and adverb phrases: [AdvP [DP "the"] "longer"] "this dish cooks," [AdvP [DP "the"] "better"] "it tastes"). Determiner phrases can also function as post head modifiers in these phrases. For example, the determiners "each", "enough", "less", and "more" can function as post head modifiers of noun phrases, as in the determiner phrase "each" in "two seats each". "Enough" can fill the same role in adjective phrases (e.g., "clear enough") and in adverb phrases (e.g., "funnily enough"). DPs also function as modifiers in DPs (e.g., ["not" "that many"] "people").. Fusion of functions. Determiners may bear two functions at one time. Usually this is a fusion of determinative and head in an NP where no head noun exists. In the clause "many would disagree", the determiner "many" is the fused determinative head in the NP that functions as the subject. In many grammars, both traditional and modern, and in almost all dictionaries, such words are considered to be pronouns rather than determiners. Types of determiners. Multiple words can belong to the same part of speech but still differ from each other to various extents, with similar words forming subclasses of the part of speech. For example, the articles "a" and "the" have more in common with each other than with the demonstratives "this" or "that", but both belong to the class of determiner and, thus, share more characteristics with each other than with words from other parts of speech. Article and demonstrative, then, can be considered subclasses or types of determiners. Morphological types. Compound determiners. Most determiners are very basic in their morphology, but some are compounds.A large group of these is formed with the words "any", "every", "no", and "some" together with "body", "one", "thing", or "where" (e.g., "anybody", "somewhere"). The morphological phenomenon started in Old English, when "thing", was combined with "some", "any", and "no". In Middle English, it would combine with "every". The cardinal numbers greater than 99 are also compound determiners. This group also includes "a few" and "a little", and Payne, Huddleston, and Pullum argue that "once", "twice", and "thrice" also belong here, and not in the adverb category. Gradable. Although most determiners do not inflect, the following determiners participate in the system of grade. Syntactic and semantic types. The following types of determiners are organized, first, syntactically according to their typical position in a noun phrase in relation to each other and, then, according to their semantic contributions to the noun phrase. This first division, based on categorization from "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language", includes three categories: The secondary divisions are based on the semantic contributions of the determiner to a noun phrase. The subclasses are named according to the labels assigned in "CGEL" and the "Oxford Modern English Grammar", which use essentially the same labels. Central determiners. Articles. According to CGEL, articles serve as "the most basic expression of definiteness and indefiniteness." That is, while other determiners express definiteness and other kinds of meaning, articles serve primarily as markers of definiteness. The articles are generally considered to be: Other articles have been posited, including unstressed "some", a zero article (indefinite with mass and plural) and a null article (definite with singular proper nouns). Demonstrative determiners. The two main demonstrative determiners are "this" and "that". Their respective plural forms are "these" and "those". The demonstrative determiners mark noun phrases as definite. They also add meaning related to spatial deixis; that is, they indicate where the thing referenced by the noun is in relation to the speaker. The proximal "this" signals that the thing is relatively close to the speaker while the distal "that" signals that the thing is relatively far. CGEL classifies the archaic and dialectal "yonder" (as in the noun phrase "yonder hills") as a marginal demonstrative determiner. "Yonder" signals that the thing referenced by the noun is far from the speaker, typically farther than what "that" would signal. Thus, we would expect yonder hills to be farther from the speaker than those hills. Unlike the main demonstrative determiners, "yonder" does not inflect for number (compare "yonder hill"). Distributive determiners. The following are the distributive determiners: The distributive determiners mark noun phrases as indefinite. They also add distributive meaning; that is, "they pick out the members of a set singly, rather than considering them in mass." Because they signal this distributive meaning, these determiners select singular noun heads when functioning as determinatives in noun phrases (e.g., "each student"). Existential determiners. The following are the existential determiners: Existential determiners mark a noun phrase as indefinite. They also convey existential quantification, meaning that they assert the existence of a thing in a quantity greater than zero. Disjunctive determiners. The following are the disjunctive determiners: Disjunctive determiners mark a noun phrase as definite. They also imply a single selection from a set of exactly two. Because they signal a single selection, disjunctive determiners select singular nouns when functioning as determinatives in noun phrases (e.g., "either side"). "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language" does not recognize this category and instead label "either" an "assertive determiner" and "neither" a "negative determiner." Negative determiner. The negative determiner is "no" with its independent form "none". Distinct dependent and independent forms are otherwise found only in possessive pronouns, where the dependent is only found with a subsequent noun and the independent without (e.g., "my way" and "no way" are dependent, while "mine" and "none" are independent). "No" signifies that not one member of a set or sub quantity of a quantity under consideration has a particular property. "Neither" also conveys this kind of meaning but is only used when selecting from a set of exactly two, which is why "neither" is typically classified as disjunctive rather than negative. Additive determiner. The additive determiner is "another". "Another" was formed from the compounding of the indefinite article "an" and the adjective "other"; thus, it marks a noun phrase as indefinite. It also conveys additive meaning. For example, "another banana" signals an additional banana in addition to some first banana. "Another" can also mark an alternative. For example, "another banana" can also signal a different banana, perhaps one that is riper. Because it can also convey this alternative meaning, "another" is sometimes labeled an alternative additive determiner. Sufficiency determiners. The following are the sufficiency determiners: These determiners convey inexact quantification that is framed in terms of some minimum quantity needed. For instance, "enough money for a taxi" implies that a minimum amount of money is necessary to pay for a taxi and that the amount of money in question is sufficient for the purpose. When functioning as determinatives in a noun phrase, sufficiency determiners select plural count nouns (e.g., "sufficient reasons") or non count nouns (e.g., "enough money"). Interrogative determiners. The following are the interrogative determiners: These determiners can also be followed by "ever" and "soever". Interrogative determiners are typically used in the formation of questions, as in "what/which conductor do you like best?" Using "what" marks a noun phrase as indefinite while using "which" marks the noun phrase as definite, being used when the context implies a limited number of choices. Relative determiners. The following are the relative determiners: These determiners can also be followed by "ever". Relative determiners typically function as determiners in noun phrases that introduce relative clauses, as in "we can use whatever/whichever edition you want". Predeterminers. Personal determiners. In grammars that consider them determiners rather than pronouns (see ), the personal determiners are the following: Though these words are normally pronouns, in phrases like "we teachers" and "you guys", they are sometimes classified as personal determiners. Personal determiners mark a noun phrase as definite. They also add meaning related to personal deixis; that is, they indicate whether the thing referenced by the noun includes the speaker ("we/us") or at least one addressee and not the speaker ("you"). In some dialects such as the Ozark dialect, this usage extends to "them" as in "them folks". Universal determiners. The following are the universal determiners: Universal determiners convey universal quantification, meaning that they assert that no subset of a thing exists that lacks the property that is described. For example, saying "all the vegetables are ripe" is the same as saying "no vegetables are not ripe." The primary difference between "all" and "both" is that "both" applies only to sets with exactly two members while "all" lacks this limitation. But CGEL notes that because of the possibility of using "both" instead, "all" "generally strongly implicates 'more than two.'" Postdeterminers. Cardinal numerals. Cardinal numerals ("zero", "one", "two", "thirty four", etc.) can represent any number. Therefore, the members of this subclass of determiner are infinite in quantity and cannot be listed in full. Cardinal numerals are typically thought to express the exact number of the things represented by the noun, but this exactness is through implicature rather than necessity. In the clause "five people complained", for example, the number of people complaining is usually thought to be exactly five. But technically, the proposition would still be true if additional people were complaining as well: if seven people were complaining, then it is also necessarily true that five people were complaining. General norms of cooperative conversation, however, make it such that cardinal numerals typically express the exact number (e.g., five = no more and no less than five) unless otherwise modified (e.g., "at least five" or "at most five"). Positive paucal determiners. The following are the positive paucal determiners: The positive paucal determiners convey a small, imprecise quantity generally characterized as greater than two but smaller than whatever quantity is considered large. When functioning as determinatives in a noun phrase, most paucal determiners select plural count nouns (e.g., "a few mistakes"), but "a little" selects non count nouns (e.g., "a little money"). Degree determiners. In grammars that consider them determiners rather than adjectives (see ), the degree determiners are the following: Degree determiners mark a noun phrase as indefinite. They also convey imprecise quantification, with "many" and "much" expressing a large quantity and "few" and "little" expressing a small quantity. Degree determiners are unusual in that they inflect for grade, a feature typical of adjectives and adverbs but not determiners. The comparative forms of "few", "little", "many", and "much" are "fewer", "less", "more", and "more" respectively. The superlative forms are "fewest", "least", "most", and "most" respectively. The plain forms can be modified with adverbs, especially "very", "too" and "so" (and "not" can also be added). Note that unmodified "much" is quite rarely used in affirmative statements in colloquial English. Semantics. The main semantic contributions of determiners are quantification and definiteness. Quantification. Many determiners express quantification. Definiteness. From a semantic point of view, a definite NP is one that is identifiable and activated in the minds of the first person and the addressee. From a grammatical point of view in English, definiteness is typically marked by definite determiners, such as "the", "that", and "this", "all", "every", "both", etc. Linguists find it useful to make a distinction between the grammatical feature of definiteness and the cognitive feature of identifiability. This accounts for cases of form meaning mismatch, where a definite determiner results in an indefinite NP, such as the example "I met this guy from Heidleberg on the train", where the underlined NP is grammatically definite but semantically indefinite. The majority of determiners, however, are indefinite. These include the indefinite article "a", but also most quantifiers, including the cardinal numerals. Pragmatics. Choosing the definite article over no article in a pair like "the Americans" and "Americans" can have the pragmatic effect of depicting "the group as a monolith of which the speaker is not a part." Relatedly, the choice between "this" and "that" may have an evaluative purpose, where "this" suggest a closeness, and therefore a more positive evaluation.

Seeing with the Eyes of Love by Eknath Easwaran is a practical commentary on "The Imitation of Christ", a Christian devotional classic of the early 15th century, believed to be the work of Thomas Kempis. Easwaran's commentary emphasizes how to translate the "Imitation" into daily living with the aid of spiritual practices. "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" was originally published in the United States in 1991. A German translation was published in 1993, and a second U.S. edition was published in 1996. The book has been reviewed in newspapers, magazines, and websites. Background. At the time "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" was published in 1991, Eknath Easwaran had served as a spiritual teacher in California since the 1960s. Easwaran taught a nonsectarian method of meditation used by spiritual aspirants within many major religious traditions, both eastern and western. Easwaran's writings include commentaries on both eastern and western scriptures and spiritual figures. Raised in South India as a Hindu, Easwaran drew inspiration also from the Christian tradition, explaining that "the message of Christ first reached me" through the lives of individual Christians, such as his college headmaster, Father John Palakaran. For spiritual inspiration, Easwaran reported that Content. "The Imitation of Christ" is a devotional book written in Latin ca.1418 1427, and believed to be the work of Thomas Kempis. In "Seeing with the Eyes of Love", Easwaran comments on a 30 verse section of "The Imitation of Christ", a section "traditionally called 'The Wonderful Effects of Divine Love,'" (Book 3, chapter 5). To Easwaran, these verses "distill the essential teachings not just of Thomas a Kempis, but of Christianity itself." Easwaran's 12 chapters discuss these verses in order, using them as points of departure for reflections on spiritual living and its fruits. Each chapter title is drawn from an "Imitation" verse "(see table, right)". Easwaran' introduction explains that he regards the "Imitation" is "an entirely practical manual for sincere spiritual aspirants," The section discussed in "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" is a "soaring hymn of love" that appears in Book III, when the "Imitation", now an "indisputably mystical treatise," has become a dialogue between God and the spiritual aspirant, with whom "each of us, clearly, is meant to identify." Easwaran's 20 page introduction also briefly summarizes his eight point program of Passage Meditation. Each chapter in the main commentary offers numerous ideas and metaphors. For example, starting in the first chapter, Easwaran comments on how a person's turn to the spiritual life can be much like falling in love: "just as great worldly romances often begin with a single, telling glance, so, very often does this one... deep within you something stirs...". Later, he draws on the metaphor of travel: "Getting ready for this inward journey is a lot like preparing for a trip... You may start by reading about it... then slowly you begin to get serious... you know you may have to carry your own bags, so you try to keep them light and portable..." As the commentary proceeds in 12 chapters through the 30 "Imitation" verses, Easwaran often highlights what he regards as important implications of each verse. For example, with regard to the second verse in Chapter 5 (""Love desires to be aloft"..."), Easwaran writes Similarly, in Chapter 12, Easwaran addresses patience, writing that "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" concludes with a 22 page afterword by Carol Flinders that profiles the "Imitation's" presumed author, Thomas Kempis (c. 1380 1471), and the times in which he lived. She states that the "Imitation" "is not so much the work of a single man as it is of an entire spiritual movement," the Brethren of the Common Life. Besides describing what is known about Thomas himself, the "Afterword" also profiles the founder of the Brethren, Geert Groote, as well as his chief disciple and successor, Florent Radewijns, who served as a mentor to Thomas. The "Afterword" also sketches the "Imitation"'s influence on figures ranging from Therese of Lisieux (who memorized it) to Ignatius of Loyola to John Woolman to Dag Hammerskjold, who carried it with him on the flight that ended in his death. An 8 page index is contained in the 1996 edition. Reception. Reviews have appeared in the "Prairie Messenger", "BC Catholic", "The Living Church", "Monastic Interreligious Dialogue", "The Small Press Book Review", "Brothers", and at the website "Spirituality and Practice." In "Prairie Messenger", a Roman Catholic publication, J. W. Gray stated that "Far from losing himself in mystical romanticism, Easwaran insists throughout that what one discovers within unites one with the community." Indeed, He added that "The simplicity, sincerity and compassion so clear in these reflections will convince the wavering to take up Easwaran's challenge." In "The Living Church", an Episcopalian magazine, Travis DuPriest stated that he "particularly liked [Easwaran's] introduction with practical advice on meditation, spiritual reading and spiritual association," calling "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" a "well written book with a strong focus on the love of God." In "The B.C. Catholic", Paul Matthew St. Pierre described "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" as an "understated work" in which the author "does not second guess Thomas a Kempis for us." But Easwaran "manages to open up the mind and spirit of Thomas a Kempis and to awaken people created in the image and likeness of God to the possibilities of imitating Jesus." He later added that in "Seeing with the Eyes of Love", "Easwaran untangles a meditative paradox of imitative faith and observance that draws people to the actuality of Jesus Christ." A reviewer in "The Small Press Book Review" stated that "woven into [Easwaran's] commentary are biographical anecdotes, references to mystics of different religions and their writings, advice on meditating, and observations on contemporary life. The variety of the subjects provides the reader with different angles on the fertile and fulfilling life of the spirit Easwaran illuminates." A reviewer in "Monastic Interreligious Dialogue" called "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" a "gem," stating that it "shows that there is much more to the ["Imitation"] than the pious rhetoric of an age of Jansenism. It centers on the basic theme of Love." In "Brothers", a Catholic monastic publication, Romeo Bonsaint stated that in addition to his reflections on the "Imitation", "Easwaran's meditations on the power of divine love provide insightful glimpses as well into the teachings on love of many other Christian mystics, among them such figures as St. Augustine, St. Teresa of Avila, Johannes Tauler, and Mechtild of Magdeburg. These many references to spiritual writers and teachers effectively communicate the essential teaching of Christianity on personality integration and service through love." Editions. The original edition was published by in the United States in 1991 by Nilgiri Press, who republished a 2nd edition in 1996 as one volume in a series entitled "Classics of Christian Inspiration". An edition was also published in German in 1993. The US editions of "Seeing with the Eyes of Love" are: The German edition:
The Hermetic Organ is an album by John Zorn, consisting of a single live improvisation on the Aeolian Skinner pipe organ of St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University, which was released on Tzadik Records in June 2012. The performance was held at 11 PM on the evening of December 9, 2011, which Zorn has noted was a full moon, as an encore to a "Composer Portrait" ensemble performance of his works held earlier that night at the Miller Theatre. It is the first release by Zorn to exclusively document his solo improvisations on the organ, his first instrument. In 2014, Zorn released a second volume of improvisations, "The Hermetic Organ Vol. 2". Reception. Lou Reed, who attended the performance, called it a night of "culmination and conquest", and Zorn himself thought highly of the improvisation, calling it "something special" and "a truly magical event." Phillip Coombs of "The Free Jazz Collective" stated "This is a type of recording that needs to be savored, played loud and with good headphones... this is a very serious recording, especially with the themes he tackles and the environment he tackles them in. Rarely is Zorn recorded solo lately and this alone makes it special".

Halesowen Velodrome is a velodrome located at Manor Abbey Stadium in Halesowen, in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the West Midlands, England. The 400m cycle track runs around the perimeter of a 350m athletics training track built for Halesowen Athletics Club. The athletics club was formed in 1939, and joined forces with local cyclists to form "Halesowen Athletic &amp; Cycling Club". During the Second World War, the club purchased former marshland to create Manor Abbey Stadium. Due to continued flooding problems, the track was raised by one metre during the 1960s; it was resurfaced in 1992, and again in 2004 by Tarmac Limited (with grant aid from British Cycling). During the summer months, the velodrome hosts a Friday night track league. Jessica Varnish is one notable rider to have developed her skills at the velodrome as a member of the Halesowen club.

Chasing Owls are a Scottish indie folk band. The band consists of Ben Sunderland (vocals, guitars), Immie Mason (vocals, keyboards, harmonium), James Moir (vocals, electric bass) and Callum Bateman (drums). The band formed in Edinburgh in early 2010. Chasing Owls' debut EP "We Began" was recorded in the Sussex town of Lewes over the New Year of 2011. With the help of producer/engineer Dave Lynch the band's fresh and original live sound was captured well and released to general critical acclaim. 'We Began' enjoyed extensive press coverage at both a regional and national level with repeated airplay across BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music complemented by the support of media heavyweights such as The Scotsman, BBC Radio Scotland, and Absolute Radio. The band concentrated on a busy summer of festivals in 2011 including Belladrum, NME Weekender and Wickerman Festivals. This saw their popularity increase throughout Scotland and helped encourage wider UK touring. Several key showcases such as GoNorth and Loopallu helped increase interest particularly in the band's live set. Chasing Owls went on to have heavy involvement with the 2012 Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow involving the launch of the festival via a live BBC session and culminating in supporting fellow Scottish band Admiral Fallow for their biggest headline show to date at the O2 ABC Glasgow. Entitled "Quell", Chasing Owls' second record is a four track EP and had its general release in late May 2012, supported by UK dates and an extensive summer festival schedule.

Currently, Marinkovic is trained by the former Olympic athlete and Gerhard Mayer.
Westringia cremnophila, commonly known as Snowy River westringia, is a flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, a rare shrub that is endemic to Victoria, Australia. It is a small shrub with leaves mostly in groups of three and white flowers. Description. "Westringia cremnophila" is a shrub to high, much branched and thickly covered with slightly flattened white hairs, and found growing out of steep cliffs. The leaves are arranged in whorls mostly in groups of three, oblong or almost linear shaped, long, wide, thickly hairy when young, becoming smooth, margins distinctly rolled under, apex rounded occasionally sharply points and on a petiole long. The flowers are in racemes, the corolla about long, white with a mauve tinge and yellow brown spotted throats. The calyx tube long, lobes about long and up to wide and the outer surface thickly covered with white hairs. Flowering occurs in spring. Taxonomy and naming. "Westringia cremnophila" was first formally described in 1957 by botanist Norman Wakefield and the description was published in "The Victorian Naturalist" based on a type specimen collected from "Porphory cliffs above Snowy River, east of Butchers Ridge". The specific epithet ("cremnophila") is in reference to its "habitat". Distribution and habitat. Snowy river westringia is restricted to Tulloch Ard Gorge in the Snowy River National Park in East Gippsland, where it grows on cliff faces above the Snowy River with a north to north east aspect. Associated plant species include shrubby platysace ("Platysace lanceolata"), violet daisy bush ("Olearia iodochroa"), digger's speedwell ("Veronica perfoliata"), common fringe myrtle ("Calytrix tetragona") and tall baeckea" (Sannantha pluriflora"). Conservation. "Westringia cremnophila" is listed as "vulnerable" under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, "vulnerable" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's "Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria" and "threatened" under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Due to the species' restricted habitat in difficult terrain, plants have proved difficult to find over the years; however in 2011 about 500 plants were located. Plants have been propagated and established at the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne as an insurance population.

The proton spin crisis (sometimes called the "proton spin puzzle") is a theoretical crisis precipitated by an experiment in 1987 which tried to determine the spin configuration of the proton. The experiment was carried out by the European Muon Collaboration (EMC). Physicists expected that the quarks carry all the proton spin. However, not only was the total proton spin carried by quarks far smaller than 100%, these results were consistent with almost zero (4 24%) proton spin being carried by quarks. This surprising and puzzling result was termed the "proton spin crisis". The problem is considered one of the important unsolved problems in physics. Background. A key question is how the nucleon's spin is distributed amongst its constituent partons (quarks and gluons). Components of proton's spin are expectation values of individual sources of angular momentum. These values depend on the renormalization scale, because their operators are not separately conserved. Physicists originally expected that quarks carry all of the nucleon spin. A proton is built from three valence quarks (two up quarks and one down quark), virtual gluons, and virtual (or "sea") quarks and antiquarks (virtual particles do not influence the proton's quantum numbers). The ruling hypothesis was that since the proton is stable, then it exists in the lowest possible energy level. Therefore, it was expected that the quark's wave function is the spherically symmetric s wave with no spatial contribution to angular momentum. The proton is, like each of its quarks, a spin 1/2 particle. Therefore, it was hypothesized that two of the quarks have their spins parallel to the proton's and the spin of the third quark is opposite. The experiment. In this EMC experiment, a quark of a polarized proton target was hit by a polarized muon beam, and the quark's instantaneous spin was measured. In a polarized proton target, all the protons' spin take the same direction, and therefore it was expected that the spin of two out of the three quarks cancels out and the spin of the third quark is polarized in the direction of the proton's spin. Thus, the sum of the quarks' spin was expected to be equal to the proton's spin. Instead, the experiment found that the number of quarks with spin in the proton's spin direction was almost the same as the number of quarks whose spin was in the opposite direction. This is the proton spin crisis. Similar results have been obtained in later experiments. Recent work. A 2008 work shows that more than half of the spin of the proton comes from the spin of its quarks, and that the missing spin is produced by the quarks' orbital angular momentum. This work uses relativistic effects together with other quantum chromodynamic properties and explains how they boil down to an overall spatial angular momentum that is consistent with the experimental data. A 2013 work shows how to calculate the gluon helicity contribution using lattice QCD. Recent Monte Carlo calculation shows that 50% of the proton spin come from gluon polarization. 2016 results from the RHIC indicate that gluons may carry even more of protons' spin than quarks do. However, recent (2018) lattice QCD calculations indicate that it is the quark orbital angular momentum that is the dominant contribution to the nucleon spin.

John Tirman is an American political theorist. Since 2004, Tirman has been executive director and principal research scientist at the MIT Center for International Studies. There he heads the Persian Gulf Initiative, which has conducted work on Iraq war mortality and U.S. Iran relations, as well as other projects. He is author or coauthor of 13 books on international affairs, many of them exploring and advocating the human security paradigm in global affairs, and is a frequent contributor to AlterNet, "The Huffington Post", and "The Boston Globe". Education and early career. Tirman was educated at Indiana University (B.A., 1972) and subsequently earned a doctorate at Boston University, where he specialized in political theory with Howard Zinn, Frances Fox Piven, Murray Levin, and Alasdair MacIntyre. His friendship with Zinn and his wife Roz lasted for nearly 40 years. Zinn told his biographer Davis Joyce that Tirman was one of his best students. Tirman worked at "Time" magazine and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). It was at UCS where he began to work on international security issues, mentored by Henry W. Kendall, the chair of UCS and a professor of physics at MIT; Kendall later was co recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics. Tirman edited two books on "star wars", the strategic defense initiative started by President Ronald Reagan; one of them, "The Fallacy of Star Wars" (Vintage, 1984), was the first important critique of strategic defense, and brought together leading scientists like Kendall, Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Richard Garwin, among others. Tirman wrote frequently on the issue for the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists", The Nation, the "Los Angeles Times", "Esquire", and others. For 12 years, beginning in 1986, he headed the Winston Foundation for World Peace, a charitable foundation created by Robert Winston Scrivner, which provided grants to NGOs working on nuclear disarmament and conflict prevention. He also headed the Henry P. Kendall Foundation and the CarEth Foundation in the mid to late 1990s, and was editor of the peace movement magazine, "Nuclear Times". Academic career. In 1999, Tirman was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to work on conflict resolution in Cyprus. He produced an educational Web site on the conflict, "The Cyprus Conflict". Returning from Cyprus, Tirman was appointed Program Director at the Social Science Research Council, a leading academic think tank, in New York in 2000. He headed the Program on Global Security and Cooperation with colleague Itty Abraham. In 2001 he opened a Washington, D.C. office for SSRC. He moved to MIT in 2004. His work there has mainly focused on U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf. He decried the war in 2002 03 in a series of articles for AlterNet, including one that predicted a few days into the war that it would become bogged down and be viewed as a failure. In 2005, Tirman commissioned the Iraq Mortality Study that was published in "The Lancet" in October 2006. The study, which was controversial at the time because of its high estimates of total excess deaths attributable to the war (~650,000), was carried out by scientists at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and in Iraq. Tirman has written frequently on the topic, including articles for "The Boston Globe", "The Washington Post", "The New York Times", "AlterNet", and others. The one independent and peer reviewed assessment of Iraq mortality estimates, in "Conflict and Health" (2008), found the Lancet published survey to be superior to all other methods. At MIT, Tirman has also undertaken several projects on U.S. Iran relations, publishing in 2009 a white paper on a New Approach to Iran for the New Ideas Fund, excoriating America's militant attitudes toward Iran and urging greater accommodation. He convened conferences and published on the regional dimension of the Iraq War, the role of terrorism in upsetting diplomatic relations, and the challenges of political instability in the Gulf. He brought to MIT such Iranian luminaries as President Mohammad Khatami, former deputy foreign minister Abbas Maleki, former reform parliamentarian Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, and dissident Akbar Ganji. Human Security. After his arms control work in the 1980s, Tirman's most significant intellectual contributions derive from his work on human security, which places human communities at the center of the security discourse and planning. In 1997, he published "Spoils of War: The Human Cost of America's Arms Trade" (Free Press), which demonstrated the human consequences of U.S. arms sales to Turkey to suppress the Kurdish rebellion. He published on this topic in "Boston Review", "Boston Globe", "The Nation", and "The Washington Post". He was also part of an informal group of activists and intellectuals advising the Clinton administration on Turkey's human rights record in the late 1990s. For this work on Kurdish rights, he was given a Human Rights Award by the United Nations Association of Washington, D.C. in 1998. Tirman has long argued that social movements can and do have important impacts on international security, a view he published in a widely cited and reproduced essay in "The Nation", "How We Ended the Cold War." The argument he made was that the peace movement convinced the American public that the Cold War was dangerous and costly, giving Reagan permission to pursue d tente with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. At SSRC, he explored how structural adjustment policies were a proximate cause of instability and conflict, convening a conference and publishing on the topic, notably in the journal, "Development". He also took up human security topics as they relate to migration; after the 9/11 attacks, he convened a group of scholars to produce the volume, "The Maze of Fear: Security and Migration After 9/11" (The New Press, 2004). In this and in work with Chatham House and others, he provided sharp critiques of the treatment of Muslim immigrants and assailed the excesses of the war on terrorism. In 2009, he co edited with Susan Martin, "Women, Migration and Conflict: Breaking a Deadly Cycle" (Springer), the result of an advisory project he convened on behalf of the U.N. Population Fund. The work on Iraqi casualties is a continuation of the human security focus in Tirman's work. In 2011, he published "The Deaths of Others: The Fate of Civilians in America's Wars" (Oxford University Press), which took up civilian suffering as a consequence of U.S. interventions in Korea, Indochina, Afghanistan, and Iraq. He published several short pieces on the topic, including articles in Alternet, the "New York Times", the "Washington Spectator", "Washington Post", and "Boston Review". Tirman has served as board co chair of the Foundation for National Progress, which publishes Mother Jones magazine; U.S. chair of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting; and trustee of International Alert.
Shuttlecock Boys is an independent film directed by Hemant Gaba &amp; produced by Pankaj Johar and Hemant Gaba. It's a film made by all first timers in the cast and crew. Most cast are non actors and didn't have any formal training. The film was shot handheld on 16 mm with sync sound using real locations in Delhi, Noida &amp; Gurgaon. Plot. "Shuttlecock Boys" revolves around the lives, successes and failures of four friends who hail from lower middle class backgrounds in Delhi. Protagonists Gaurav, Manav, Pankaj and Loveleen seek answer to the questions like "should we accept what life offers to us on a platter or should we try to chase our dreams, taking the path less taken?." They decide to embark upon an eventful journey that will change the course of their lives and careers forever. The one thing that unites these four friends is their common love for badminton. Every evening they meet for a couple of games in their neighbourhood joking about their lives and pulling each other's legs. This part of the day is the most pleasant part of their otherwise dreary lives. While playing badminton one such night, they decide to do something on their own. This very attempt becomes their lifeline putting them on a litmus test of determination, courage, luck and spirit of friendship. Production. The film was shot in 18 locations over a period of 22 days in Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida. There were no formal permissions to shoot on the roads, markets and highway, so everything was done in a Guerilla Style. The interiors were all real locations mostly office locations and houses. Not having money to light exteriors in the night, a 5 row grid was created of Chinese Lanterns (having 5 of them in each row) by DOP Shanti Bhushan &amp; Associate Cameraman Nuthan Nagraj to shoot badminton scenes in the night. There were not enough funds to hire professionals in key areas like Production Design, Costume &amp; Line Production. Bhavya Palia who had never even seen a film set joined stepped in as Line Producer in the very last moments just before the shoot and eventually managed the production along with Producer / Executive Producer Pankaj Johar. Prachi Singh who was initially hired just as an Assistant Director ended up donning multiple hats and handled costumes and production design. Catering was managed by Pushpa Gaba from Director/Producers' homes. Music. There are four songs in the film All four songs are composed &amp; sung by Avinash Baghel. The songs have been used as background score. Reviews. Shuttlecock Boys had a limited release in theaters in select cities on 3 August 2012.

Qilu Lake () is a plateau lake in Yunnan Province, in southwestern China. The lake has a total area of about 36.86 square kilometers. The average depth is 4.03 m, with an elevation of 1796.75 m. the water storage capacity is about 1.486 108m3. The lake is named after the Qilu mountain (nowadays called Xiushan), directly south of Tonghai county seat. During the Yuan dynasty, the lake used to be larger and reach up to the base of this mountain. The lake has no outlet rivers, but water can leave the area through karst caves. It has a rich aquatic life, supporting a large population of shrimp, carp, black carp, herring, and catfish. According to local legend, the area around the lake used to be flooded and was called Tonghai. A monk used a shippei to make a hole in the lake bed and allow water to flow out. In the 20th century, the lake size was reduced due to soil erosion and land reclamation, as well as the lake becoming polluted. Since the 1990s, measures have been taken to reverse this.

Il templario is an Italian language opera by the German composer Otto Nicolai from a libretto written by based on Walter Scott's 1819 novel "Ivanhoe". It has been noted that Nicolai's work for the opera stage, which followed the successful "Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor" ("The Merry Wives of Windsor)" (his only German opera), included three others, all of which were in Italian (two being "Gilippede ed Odoardo" and "Il proscritto") and all "are all firmly cast in the "bel canto" style, with gracefully flowing melodies in the manner of Bellini". Marini was a part time poet when not employed by the government tobacco monopoly, and is best remembered today for being called in to rewrite the third act of Donizetti's "Adelia." "Il templario" received its premiere performances at the Teatro Regio, Turin in February 11, 1840, and continued on a successful run through Italy, rivaling Pacini's "Saffo". However, it disappeared for over 160 years until it was reconstructed in 2006 and performed in 2008. The success of Nicolai's opera had an unintended contributing indirect effect on the failure of Verdi's early attempt at the "opera buffa" genre, "Un giorno di regno", in 1840. The Teatro alla Scala impresario Merelli insisted on using the "opera seria" singers previously assembled for Nicolai's opera, which had toured in Milan, thus contributing to the disaster experienced by Verdi. Performance history. Following its first Italian performances Laviska notes that: After its original highly successful run in Italy, "Il templario" was forgotten, as fashion moved on and Nicolai's early death reduced interest in his work outside Germany. His father sold his autographs to Bote &amp; Bock, who then filed and forgot them until 1937 when Joseph Goebbels was seeking pure German operas to replace the removal of works by composers such as Meyerbeer from the German stage. Goebels was attracted to the story of Ivanhoe but sought to have Nicolai's opera rewritten to remove the flattering elements around the Jewish heroine Rebecca. However, the Second World War intervened before such a version could be made. The rediscovered opera was again "lost" when the archives of both Bote &amp; Bock in Berlin and Casa Ricordi in Milan were destroyed during World War II. Re discovery and reconstruction However interest in Nicolai renewed in the 1990s and the music historian Michael Wittmann was finally able to reconstruct "Il templario" from various versions. These included a revision originally deposited with the local censor in Naples but found in the Conservatorio di Musica under the title "Teodosia", a German language edition, and also a French piano vocal score, which allowed for the complete reconstruction in 2006. Following Wittmann's reconstruction, "Il templario" was then performed at the Chemnitz Opera in March 2008 conducted by Frank Beermann, with the American tenor Stanley Jackson as Ivanhoe. A live recording of the 7 March performance was later issued. Synopsis. Following the story line of "Ivanhoe", Vilfredo d'Ivanhoe is in love with Ravena, the ward of his father Cedrico, who wishes to marry her off for political advantage. Cedrico turns against his son, leading Ivanhoe to leave for the Crusades. Ivanhoe is wounded and cared for by the Jewish Rebecca, who with her father Isacco follows Ivanhoe back to England. Rebecca is in turn loved by Briano, the templar of the opera's title. Briano and Rebecca are both inexplicably struck dead in the final scene of the opera, leaving the Anglo Saxons praising Ivanhoe.

"Paste" gave it a score of 7.8 out of ten and stated: "The simple fact that Aimee Mann continues writing songs around these distressing observations and putting them out on such achingly beautiful records seems proof that despite all the twisted, cutting truths she's spied under the lens of her artistic microscope she still somehow clings to the sable cloud's silver flash." "The A.V. Club" gave it a B and said that Mann "is able to match her ideas to music with real kick." Other reviews are average or mixed: "Q" gave the album three stars out of five and called Mann "good and snarky". "The New York Times" gave it an average review and said it "represents a sunny term for [Mann], at least in relative terms."

The History of Jerusalem during the Kingdom of Jerusalem begins with the siege of the city in 1099 as part of the First Crusade. This resulted in Jerusalem being conquered by Christian forces, after it had been under Muslim rule for nearly 450 years. It became the capital of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, until it was again conquered by the Ayyubids under Saladin in 1187. For the next forty years, a series of Christian campaigns, including the Third and Fifth Crusades, attempted in vain to retake the city, until Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II led the Sixth Crusade and successfully negotiated its return in 1229. In 1244, the city was taken by Khwarazmian troops. After 1260 the Ayyubid realm that included Jerusalem was taken over by the Mamluks of Egypt and the city was gradually rebuilt during the later 13th century, while the shrinking coastal Crusader state was gradually defeated until its final demise in 1291. Overview. The Crusaders conquered the city in 1099 and held it until its conquest by the army of Saladin at the siege of Jerusalem in 1187 and its surrender to the Ayyubid dynasty, a Muslim sultanate that ruled in the Middle East in the early 12th century. The Sixth Crusade put Jerusalem back under Crusader rule from 1229 1244, until the city was captured by the Khwarazmians. The Crusader Ayyubid conflict ended with the rise of the Mamluks from Egypt in 1260 and their conquest of the Holy Land. The Ayyubid period ended with waves of destruction of the city. Its fortifications were destroyed first, and later most of the buildings, as part of a deliberate scorched earth policy intended to prevent all future crusades from gaining a foothold in the city and region. This was a short but relatively turbulent and significant period in the history of Jerusalem. For the first time since the destruction of the city in 70 CE, Jerusalem was the capital of a separate political entity, a status only regained during the British Mandate in the 20th century. The Crusader period in the history of Jerusalem decisively influenced the history of the whole Middle East, radiating beyond the region into the Islamic World and Christian Europe. The Crusades elevated the position of Jerusalem in the hierarchy of places holy to Islam, but it did not become a spiritual or political center of Islam. By the end of the Ayyubid period the name of Jerusalem was no longer connected to the idea of jihad, and the city's geopolitical status declined, becoming a secondary city, first for the Mamluk Empire, and later for the Ottomans. Christian control (1099 1187). Crusader conquest of Jerusalem. The conquest of Jerusalem became the prime objective of the First Crusade, which was launched in 1095 with Pope Urban II's call to arms. Four main Crusader armies left Europe in August 1096. On June 7, 1099, the crusaders arrived at Jerusalem. The city was besieged by the army beginning on July 13. Attacks on the city walls started on July 14, with a huge battering ram and two siege towers. On July 15 by noon the Crusaders were on the northern wall and the Muslim defenses collapsed. Capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. With the conquest of Jerusalem, most Crusaders returned home to Europe, and only a small number of pilgrims settled in the Holy Land. They faced vast challenges, including having their capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem outside the main trade routes and away from coastal ports. The Crusaders' massacre in Jerusalem created a dramatic change in the composition of the population. Muslims and Jews were murdered or deported and banned from the city. William of Tyre wrote: After the conquest, Jerusalem was emptied of inhabitants, and many houses were abandoned. The Latin city's population was very small and centered upon the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Tower of David. William of Tyre wrote: The Crusaders' first step was to stop the fleeing population by announcing a law that a person holding an asset for a year becomes its owner. Real improvement was achieved by populating Jerusalem with residents belonging to sects of Eastern Christianity. First, Christians who had been deported before the siege were returned to the city and named by the Crusaders as "Syrian." At the same time, the local authorities encouraged other Christians to settle in Jerusalem Christians, although suspicious relations between these various groups and the struggle for supremacy and control of the Holy Sepulchre caused many problems. In 1115 Syrian Christians, uprooted from their homes in Transjordan, settled in the city, creating a continuously populated district on the north side of town, which was named after them. Simultaneously, the Crusader rulers encouraged commerce, and in 1120 King Baldwin II of Jerusalem imposed duties on goods and food products brought into Jerusalem. This was then extended to all types of trade and all agricultural food products brought from the hinterland into the city. Unusually for a city in the Middle Ages, the economy of Jerusalem relied heavily on the tourism of pilgrims from Christian Europe. It received a further boost when it was exempted from customs enabling the city's markets to develop and sell the pilgrims imported goods. The importance of this industry continued to grow with the establishment of Jerusalem as a holy place, which also led to improved roads and traffic safety. Another factor affecting the economy of the city was the various administrative centers regal, ecclesiastical, and military that operated from Jerusalem. Being a capital city, Jerusalem was the center of a number of military orders. The oldest was the Knights Hospitaller, which was originally established to provide medical assistance to Christian pilgrims who travelled to Jerusalem. In time, the order assumed military functions to fight against Muslims. Its first location was in a place that is now known as Muristan, close to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The order built hospital and a shelter for pilgrims there. Benjamin of Tudela said that the Order was set to fight against the infidels' 400 knights riding. The second order was the Knights Templar, founded in 1118. Its official function, as stated in the founders' declaration, was to protect the Crusader kingdom in the Holy Land and the pilgrims' access to the holy places in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Alongside the protection of pilgrims, the Templars provided a significant military force that included thousands of soldiers, with several hundred knights, in defense of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Templars established their headquarters at Al Aqsa Mosque and over time added complex structures and strengthened the fortifications. Benjamin of Tudela said that "300 knights" out of Solomon's Temple were ready to fight the enemies of the Christian faith. Another order, the Order of Saint Lazarus, was founded to care for leprosy patients. A special place was set for them outside of the walls of Jerusalem, named after Saint Lazarus. This Leper House gave its name to leper colonies established all over Europe. The Order of Saint Lazarus included both lepers and healthy people who held religious and military positions. This phenomenon, a military religious order of lepers who took an active part in the country alongside a healthy population, had no parallel in Europe at that time. Ayyubid control (1187 1229). Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem. After the victory of the Muslims in the Battle of Hattin on July 4, 1187, almost all the cities and citadels of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were conquered by the Muslim army led by Saladin. On September 17, Muslim troops came against the walls of Jerusalem, and on September 20, Saladin himself at the head of his army besieged Jerusalem, which contained about 30,000 residents and another 30,000 refugees from around the Christian Holy Land. The siege was relatively short but intense and violent, as both sides saw the city as their religious and cultural center. After bitter fighting, the Muslims were able to undermine the city's fortifications in the area between Damascus Gate and Herod's Gate, near where the Crusaders broke into the town in 1099. The defenders realized that they were doomed, and that it was not possible to maintain the Christian conquest of Jerusalem. At the request of the Latin Patriarch Hiraklios, and probably under pressure from the civilian population, the Christians decided to enter into negotiations with Saladin, leading to a conditional surrender. The Crusaders threatened to harm the Islamic holy sites on the Temple Mount, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque if the blockade continued. This threat, combined with pressure from the Muslim battalion commanders to end the fighting, led to the signing of a contract which surrendered the city to Saladin, making the residents prisoners of war who could redeem themselves for a fee. On October 2 Jerusalem was given to Saladin. The rich of the city, including the Dean and Latin Christians, managed to save themselves, but the poor and refugees who had come to the city with nothing were unable to pay the ransom. Most of the church treasures were taken from the city by the Latin Patriarch, who passed them to the Muslim cavalry in order to release certain prisoners. Saladin released thousands of others without compensation, including Queen Sybil, wife of Guy de Lusignan, king of Jerusalem, who was allowed to visit her husband in prison in Nablus . About 15,000 Christians were left destitute in the city. After 40 days, they were taken as prisoners in convoys to Muslim cities such as Damascus and Cairo, where they spent their lives as slaves. Christians who managed to escape from Palestine and Jerusalem went through ports controlled by the Egyptians, such as Ashkelon, and even Alexandria, where they were loaded on to ships of the Italian communes on their way to Europe. The fall of Jerusalem and the holy places shocked Europe. The shock led to the sudden death of Pope Urban III, and the departure of the Third Crusade. For Saladin, the conquest of Jerusalem was a significant political achievement, placing him as the defender of religion and a legendary military commander in chief, and giving him special status in the Muslim world. Jerusalem under the Muslims. After the conquest of Jerusalem, Saladin acted to erase the city's Christian character. Crusader additions to buildings were destroyed. In the Dome of the Rock, statues and altars were removed and the building returned to being a mosque. The great Church of Saint Mary building became a hospital. The Church of St. Anne became a madrasa, and other churches were destroyed and their stones used to repair damage from the siege. In addition, much attention was devoted to the restoration and enhancement of the fortifications of the city to prepare for a possible future attack by the Christians. The Crusaders had been driven from the city, but local Christians belonging to the Orthodox Churches, remained in the city as dhimmis by paying a poll tax (Arabic: Jizz'ya ), and in return were allowed to stay in the city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was handed over to the Greek Orthodox community, and the keys of the church were entrusted to two Muslim families. To strengthen the position and image of the Muslims of Jerusalem, Saladin created a system of "waqf", which sustained religious institutions in Jerusalem, such as schools and mosques, by linking revenues and rent to assets, providing endowments which funded the ongoing maintenance of the buildings and supported believers. The Christian world's response came quickly, and the Third Crusade came from Europe in 1190, seeking to reverse the effects of the defeat at the Battle of Hattin, and retake the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the city of Jerusalem. Fighting began with the siege of Acre (1189 91), and from there the Crusaders, led by Richard the Lionheart, moved on to Jerusalem. After the military success in the Battle of Arsuf, the Crusaders arrived at Jerusalem, but for various tactical and political reasons, withdrew and decided not to try to conquer it. Instead, both sides entered negotiations, during which Saladin declared that the idea of jihad and the sanctity of Jerusalem to Islam receive a new and central meaning. In a letter to the king of England, he admitted that he could not discuss the future of Jerusalem: Eventually, after concluding the Treaty of Jaffa with Saladin in 1192, whereby Christians were granted freedom to make pilgrimages to the holy places, Richard the Lionheart departed from the Holy Land and returned to Europe. Destruction of much of Jerusalem. With the death of Saladin in 1193, the Ayyubid Empire disintegrated and was divided among his sons. This led to struggles between various principalities as alliances were formed and dissolved. Jerusalem lost its status as the capital and religious center, and became a provincial city in an empire whose center was often Damascus or Cairo. However, for the Crusaders it remained a focus for Christian Muslim conflict. This combination of reduced geopolitical status and inter religious strife brought devastation to the city during the Fifth Crusade. The Ayyubid ruler of Syria, Al Mu'azzam decided to systematically destroy the fortifications in Jerusalem, worried the Crusaders would retake the heavily fortified city. The Sultan's command to raze much of the town to the ground seemed so implausible that it took his personal presence in Jerusalem to carry it out. The city suffered severe destruction, with all fortifications destroyed except the Tower of David, and many buildings destroyed as well. Much of the population fled the city due to the fear of living in a city without fortifications from invasion. The brother of Al Mu'azzam, al Malik al K mil, later referred to Jerusalem post destruction as merely "some churches and some ruined houses". The marketplace, government buildings and holy sites survived, but little else did. Christian control (1229 1244). Attempts to restore Christian power in Jerusalem during the 1190s to 1210s were unsuccessful. The Sixth Crusade led by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor left Italy in 1228. The death of al Mu'azzam negated the proposed alliance with al Kamil, who along with his brother al Ashraf had taken possession of Damascus (as well as Jerusalem) from their nephew, al Mu'azzam's son an Nasir Dawud. However, al Kamil presumably did not know of the small size of Frederick's army, nor the divisions within it caused by his excommunication, and wished to avoid defending his territories against another crusade. Frederick's presence alone was sufficient to regain Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and a number of surrounding castles without a fight: these were recovered in February 1229, in return for a ten year truce with the Ayyubids and freedom of worship for Jerusalem's Muslim inhabitants. The terms of the treaty were unacceptable to the Patriarch of Jerusalem Gerald of Lausanne, who placed the city under interdict. In March, Frederick crowned himself in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but because of his excommunication and the interdict Jerusalem was never truly reincorporated into the kingdom, which continued to be ruled from Acre. The treaty with the Ayyubids was set to expire in 1239. Plans for a new crusade to be led by Frederick came to nothing, and Frederick himself was excommunicated by Gregory IX again in 1239. However, other European nobles took up the cause, including Theobald IV, Count of Champagne and King of Navarre, Peter of Dreux, and Amaury VI of Montfort, who arrived in Acre in September 1239. Theobald was elected leader of the crusade at a council in Acre, attended by the most of the important nobles of the kingdom, including Walter of Brienne, John of Arsuf, and Balian of Sidon. The crusaders may have been aware of the new divisions among the Ayyubids; al Kamil had occupied Damascus in 1238 but had died soon afterwards, and his territory was inherited by his family. His sons al Adil abu Bakr and as Salih Ayyub inherited Egypt and Damascus. The Ayyubids were still divided between Ayyub in Egypt, Isma'il in Damascus, and Dawud in Kerak. Isma'il, Dawud, and al Mansur Ibrahim of Homs went to war with Ayyub, who hired the Khwarazmians to fight for him. With Ayyub's support the Khwarazmians sacked Jerusalem in the summer of 1244, leaving it in ruins and useless to both Christians and Muslims. In October, the Khwarazmians, along with the Egyptian army under the command of Baibars, were met by the Frankish army, led by Philip of Montfort, Walter of Brienne, and the masters of the Templars, Hospitallers, and Teutonic Knights, along with al Mansur and Dawud. On October 17 the Egyptian Khwarazmian army destroyed the Frankish Syrian coalition, and Walter of Brienne was taken captive and later executed. By 1247, Ayyub had reoccupied most of the territory that had been conceded in 1239, and had also gained control of Damascus. Mamluk control after 1260. There is little evidence to indicate whether or not the Mongol raids penetrated Jerusalem in either 1260 or 1300. Historical reports from the time period tend to conflict, depending on which nationality of historian was writing the report. There were also a large number of rumors and urban legends in Europe, claiming that the Mongols had captured Jerusalem and were going to return it to the Crusaders. However, these rumors turned out to be false. The general consensus of modern historians is that though Jerusalem may or may not have been subject to raids, that there was never any attempt by the Mongols to incorporate Jerusalem into their administrative system, which is what would be necessary to deem a territory "conquered" as opposed to "raided". Even during the conflicts, pilgrims continued to come in small numbers. Pope Nicholas IV negotiated an agreement with the Mamluk sultan to allow Latin clergy to serve in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. With the Sultan's agreement, Pope Nicholas, a Franciscan himself, sent a group of friars to keep the Latin liturgy going in Jerusalem. With the city little more than a backwater, they had no formal quarters, and simply lived in a pilgrim hostel, until in 1300 King Robert of Sicily gave a large gift of money to the Sultan. Robert asked that the Franciscans be allowed to have the Sion Church, the Mary Chapel in the Holy Sepulchre, and the Nativity Cave, and the Sultan gave his permission. But the remainder of the Christian holy places were kept in decay. Mamluk sultans made a point of visiting the city, endowing new buildings, encouraging Muslim settlement, and expanding mosques. During the reign of Sultan Baibars, the Mamluks renewed the Muslim alliance with the Jews and he established two new sanctuaries, one to Moses and one to Salih, to encourage numerous Muslim and Jewish pilgrims to be in the area at the same time as the Christians, who filled the city during Easter. In 1267 Nahmanides (also known as Ramban) made aliyah. In the Old City he established the Ramban Synagogue, the oldest active synagogue in Jerusalem. However, the city had no great political power, and was in fact considered by the Mamluks as a place of exile for out of favor officials. The city itself was ruled by a low ranking emir.

Upon first meeting you at TEDGlobal, I could see that you believed in my message and in this book even before I did. You alone sustained the idea of this book through our early conversations and interviews. You won the precious attention of William Clark, our agent. And, while I was quivering with fear, it was your excellent book proposal that brought us into the hands of Palgrave Macmillan and Laurie Harting. Even once we started, there were many more moments than I care to remember when, had it not been for your constant and quiet encouragement, I might not have stuck with it. And your calming presence at our early morning writing sessions was instrumental in giving me the courage to face up to my terror and put pen to paper. But more than anything, thanks for your friendship and loyalty to me and to the book through the various changes and transformations of the project. Thanks also to your son, Oliver, for having parted with you during your visits to Zurich. " One of her articles on the subject won the 2014 Best Feature award at the Science Writers' Awards for Britain and Ireland.

Petersham ribbon, also called Petersham facing or simply Petersham, is a thick, stiff, flexible corded ribbon usually made out of either cotton, rayon, viscose, or a cotton/ rayon or viscose blend of fibers and used as facing by milliners and tailors. Petersham is frequently watered on both sides and comes with a scalloped edge. It is woven so that once steamed, it will take on and support a particular curve of fabric. This makes it useful for obtaining a smooth edge on the brim of a hat, for example, without forming puckers or wrinkles which would result from the use of traditional flat ribbon or other flat fabric. It is also useful as an alternative to bias tape for making fabric conform closely to the shape of the body wearing it in a corset, for example, or along the waistline of a pair of trousers or a skirt. Petersham is utilized in couture sewing as a form of interfacing as way to stabilize waistbands. Petersham is very similar to grosgrain ribbon in appearance: both have closely spaced horizontal ridges, but Petersham has a flexible picot edge allowing it to be shaped with an iron, whereas grosgrain cannot be shaped this way. Petersham is named after the eighteenth century English lord Viscount Petersham who invented an overcoat and breeches made of a special heavy woollen cloth with a round nap surface. For this reason, "Petersham" is often (but not always) capitalized.

Berg (1964) was the first novel by the British experimental writer Ann Quin. Writing and publication. Quin wrote the novel while working as a secretary. She then had a nervous breakdown, suffering from hallucinations, but received treatment from a psychiatrist and soon after she recovered, the novel was accepted by publisher John Calder. Calder was a leading figure of the literary avant garde of the time, publishing Samuel Beckett, Alexander Trocchi, William S. Burroughs, and others. It slipped out of print in the 1970s, before being reissued by Dalkey in 2001. Plot and style. Above are the book's first lines, which have been called one of the greatest openings of any book. "Berg" is set in the English seaside town of Brighton, which was also where Quin grew up, and her home for most of her life, until her death by suicide in 1973; the action takes place in winter when the resort was empty and desolately atmospheric. The plot has echoes of Oedipus and Freudian theory, involving a romantic triangle between a man, his father, and the father's mistress Judith. The son attempts to murder the father, but ends up mutilating a ventriloquist's dummy and dragging it around town convinced it is his father's corpse. Events are resolved with an almost circular ending. The novel is written in a kind of internal monologue by Berg/Greb, which mingles description, speech, and thoughts, without clearly distinguishing them, and filtering everything through the central character's viewpoint. Much of the novel takes place under the influence of alcohol, which adds to the confusing, dream like atmosphere. However, Quin also includes elements of British spy fiction and the crime novel, in the melodramatic way the son stakes out his father's flat and tries to kill the old man; Giles Gordon detected the influence of Graham Greene. Reception. Upon release, "Berg" received considerable attention from reviewers. John Coleman gave it a mixed review in "The Guardian", finding an "unusual, rather funny story" hidden beneath Quin's challenging prose, which he criticised for "self indulgence" but praised for her descriptions and brutal dialogue. Mary Conroy in the "Sunday Times" called it "Beckett minus his humour and variety"; although she found the childhood scenes vivid, she complained about Quin's recourse to sexual violence and the confusing style. More recently "Berg" has been praised for introducing to British fiction the techniques of the European experimental novel, the nouveau roman of Alain Robbe Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute. However at the time of "Berg", it is not clear if Quin had read any of their writing. Writer Lee Rourke has variously called it "one of the great British novels", "beautiful", "dark, esoteric, haunting", and "the best novel ever set in Brighton". While critics have bemoaned "Berg"'s lack of influence on later British literature, it did have some followers, inspiring works such as Stewart Home's experimental novel "69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess". Movie. "Berg" was adapted into the 1989 film Killing Dad, written and directed by Michael Austin and starring Richard E Grant as the son, Denholm Elliott as the father, and Julie Walters as the mistress, Judith. "The Times" commented "nothing is funny" but predicted "better things beckon" for Austin. "Time Out" was also critical, saying Austin's "caricatures go through the motions of an Oedipal murder plot in perfunctory fashion", and complaining about the lack of compassion. Walters' and Elliotts' performances were praised, though Grant was less impressive due to an odd wig and unconvincing accent.

They agree that Berg should travel alone to Southend on Sea to meet him but on the way there he changes the name on his sample case from Berg to Greb, using this pseudonym when he checks in to the hotel his father is staying in. Although his father has gone out, Berg introduces himself to Judith, his much younger partner, and learns that his father is also going by a pseudonym, Mr. Hedge. It becomes apparent that rather than reuniting with his father, Berg intends to murder him, something he makes several unsuccessful attempts at, the first one being when his father, Nathy, arrives back at the hotel late that night and, after introducing himself but not revealing he is his son, Berg attempts to kill him with a hammer but is unable to sum up the courage. The next day Berg accompanies Judith to the bingo, where a fight breaks out. Back in the hotel, Judith throws Nathy out, and he enlists Berg to help him remove some of his belongings from the room which include a ventriloquist's dummy he performs with. Shortly after this, they flee Nathy's new lodgings due to him being unable to pay in advance and whilst on the seafront Berg makes another failed attempt at patricide, this time failing to drum up the courage to push his father off the pier. Back in the hotel, Judith and Nathy reunite and hold a party; meanwhile, another of the hotel's guests, a Spanish flamenco dancer named Luisa, makes cryptic references to Berg about both the Oedipus complex and that she somehow knows that Nathy is his father. After another argument, however, Judith throws the ventriloquists dummy out of a window, from where the same gang who started the fight at the bingo take it and put it on a bonfire before Nathy and Berg manage to retrieve it. Later that night, Berg finally believes he has achieved what he set out to do when he strangles his sleeping father in his bedroom. The next day he confesses to Judith and they wrap the body in a rug and deposit it in the lost property office of the train station. However, during a celebratory dinner the landlady of the hotel brings them a letter from Nathy that she says he hand delivered that morning, leading Judith to question whether Berg really did kill him, and it transpires that he had mistakenly strangled the dummy, thinking it was his father, who is still alive. Luisa now leaves for Broadstairs, where her next performance is due to take place, and as Berg bids her farewell his mother arrives at the train station in order to check on his progress, unaware of what has been going on. Judith has also transferred her affections to Berg, a relationship of which his mother does not approve, and after warning him about her she returns home. Back on the seafront, Berg and Nathy again encounter the gang, who steal a pram from a mother and put an unwilling Nathy in it, an escapade that ends up with Nathy, Berg and one of the gang members all in the sea. Having been rescued, Nathy again departs, and Berg and Judith vacate the hotel and travel to his mother's house in order to inform her of their engagement. Berg enters the house alone only to discover Nathy and his mother in bed together, which appears to trigger some sort of breakdown in Berg and leads him to flee the house and escape over the fence at the bottom of the garden, leaving an unwitting Judith waiting in the car. He then catches a bus that he hopes will take him to Broadstairs so that he can reunite with Luisa. Music. The music was by Chaz Jankel and David Storrs, with Juan Martin composing and conducting the flamenco guitar music. It also features the songs Summer Holiday and Run Rabbit Run. Critical Reception. Time Out was not hugely positive about the film, saying that it made a brief tour through the stock room of British film comedy' and that director Austin seems to aspire to the satirical bite of Mike Leigh, but never achieves the accuracy, let alone the truth.' It added that Grant, struggling against being upstaged by a 1964 Beatles wig, employs his usual nose wrinkling, eye popping mannerisms' whilst using an unconvincing accent, but was more positive about his co stars, praising Elliott as wonderfully seedy' and saying that Walters brought some much needed warmth to her gin sodden vamp: convincing, funny and sad.' The reviewer for Variety, however, was more positive about Grant, describing his performance as gently menacing' and all the acting as first rate', though felt that overall the film was not a success, saying of Austin that unfortunately his script is not up to par. The black humor he is trying for does not come off and he has to resort to slapstick to get the odd laugh.' Grant's book "With Nails: The Film Diaries of Richard E. Grant", which covers most of the films he appeared in between 1987 and 1994, makes no mention of the film, though his personal website quotes him as describing it as a flick that played one week in the West End and then went straight to video' and that his hairstyle in it is the best thing about the film'. In addition, Giles Gordon, in his introduction to the 2001 reissue of the source novel, Berg, does not mention the film adaptation. Trivia. Anna Chancellor has a small, non speaking role as a barmaid in the bingo hall that Judith and Berg visit.

Bhanu Sri Mehra is an Indian film actress who has appeared in Telugu, Tamil and Punjabi films. Career. Hailing from Amritsar, Punjab, Bhanu Sri finished her schooling in Dehradun, Uttarakhand and moved to Mumbai, Maharashtra to pursue her graduation in Mass Media. She then started modelling for commercials and print ads. She made her debut in Gunasekhar's "Varudu", which featured her alongside Allu Arjun and Arya. Prior to release, the film opted not to show any promotional material of Bhanu Sri to keep in line with the film, where Allu Arjun's character only sees her face at their wedding. The film opened to mixed reviews and was a box office bomb. The film's failure meant that she went unnoticed and did not get a lead role in a high profile Telugu film subsequently. Before "Varudu", she had done a cameo in the Bollywood film "Bachna Ae Haseeno". Bhanu Sri later went on to play the second lead in the Tamil film "Udhayan" alongside Arulnithi and Pranitha, which failed to achieve success, too. While she appeared in secondary characters mostly in low profile Telugu and Tamil films in the following years, she landed starring roles in three films in the Punjabi language, her mother tongue. She also shot for a Hindi film titled "Boyss Toh Boyss Hain". Several Telugu projects, including "Chilkur Balaji", "Prematho Cheppana", "Maharaja Sri Galigadu", "Lingadu Ramalingadu", and "Antha Nee Mayalone", all films she had started filming for, did not see a theatrical release. In 2015, she signed up a new Tamil film, "Simba", which would see her playing a news reporter. She has completed her first Kannada film, "Deal Raja", too.
Judicial Correction Services, Incorporated (Delaware) (JCS) is a privately held probation company established in 2001 and based in Georgia. Its CEO is Robert McMichael of Atlanta, GA. The company acts as a self funding probation agency for local courts, mostly in the southeast United States. The company is part of the private "extra carceral" or "alternatives to incarceration" industry, which includes private halfway houses, probation services and/or electronic monitoring. This industry, which includes services such as Judicial Correctional Service is "offender funded", shifting the cost of probation onto probationers. The industry includes private extra carceral institutions such as halfway houses, probation services and electronic monitoring. In 2008, 2009 and 2010 J.C.S. was listed by Inc.'s as "the fastest growing company in the United States. In 2011 J.C.S was acquired by Correctional Healthcare Companies. In a July 2012 case regarding the contract between Judicial Correction Services and Harpersville, Alabama, Judge Hub Harrington accused JCS of egregious abuses which were akin to "debtors' prison" and an "extortion racket" condoned by the elected officials of Harpersville in their aggressive pursuit of fines owed the Harpersville Municipal Court. If a person is sentenced to parole for committing a misdemeanor such as the inability to pay traffic fines, J.C.S ensures the probationer meets all the conditions of parole and requires the probationer to pay various fees (in addition to fines) that provide a significant profit to the firm. Persons who are unwilling or unable to pay the fine and fees or who otherwise fail to meet the conditions of parole can be jailed. J.C.S. operates in an environment where municipal courts across the United States are under considerable financial strain. By instigating the "offender funded" initiative, that was once financed by government services, offender funded companies save the public purse while turning a profit. Aggressive pursuit of these fines and fees can double collections in some areas. On its website, the company claims all the courts it services have increased collections. By 2009 JCS employed about 300 people and reported revenues of more than thirteen million dollars. In 2010, JCS had management issues and a restructuring of the command structure. The regional manager had numerous internal and external sexual harassment claims. That supervisor was given the option to resign only after the company received negative publicity. Numerous women were arbitrarily terminated or denied advancement in favor of guys with legit criminal records. That regional manager struck up a friendship with judge sparks and currently runs the birmingham municipal court. Controversies. A Birmingham, Alabama lawyer William M. Dawson filed a lawsuit against Judicial Correction Services and Harpersville Municipal Court. In July 2012, Judge Hub Harrington of Shelby County, Alabama halted the company's aggressive pursuit of fines owed the Harpersville Municipal Court. He stated, Judge Harrington found that Harpersville Municipal Court's actions "repeatedly violated the constitutional rights of defendants" who were trapped by JCS into paying several times the amount of their original no leniency court imposed fines and fees. In his findings Judge Harrington described how under the contract between Judicial Correction Services and Harpersville a defendant who is unable to immediately pay in full a fine of $200 on the day of trial is placed on probation. JCS probation office charges the defendant a monthly fee which is so high that it would take 14 months to pay it off at a total cost of $200. Sometimes the JCS monthly fees would be even higher, requiring an "additional 40 months of payments totaling $2,100." However, Bernard Harwood, a former associate justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who was hired by JCS to review its practices, "found that the company was merely doing the job it had been hired to do, and that any jailing for debt was not the fault of JCS, because private probation companies do not have the legal authority to send people to jail or to determine indigence.". In a 23 June 2014 in depth article in The New Yorker journalist Sarah Stillman investigated whether lucrative profits from injustice were being made by the private "alternatives to incarceration" industry. Her article focused on J.C.S. On March 11, 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed suit accusing the firm of violating federal racketeering laws by extorting money from impoverished Alabamians by threatening them with jail when they fall behind on paying fines from traffic violations or other citation. As part of the settlement agreement, the city of Clanton dropped its contract with Judicial Correction Services. As a result, cities across Alabama have begun to drop contracts with Judicial Correction Services. On March 22, 2015, television comedian and commentator John Oliver did a segment on municipal violations on his weekly HBO show, "Last Week Tonight." Part of the segment included details on the questionable operating methods of the firm and how their actions, in several cases, have only served to increase the debt of those who need to pay fines due to municipal violations.

The cutoff of the College of Vocational Studies is comparatively high for these courses.
National Non Fiction Day (NNFD) is annual celebration of children's non fiction in the UK. It was initiated by The Federation of Children's Book Groups in partnership with Scholastic Children's Books and is celebrated across the UK each year on the first Thursday in November (at approximately the same time as the announcement of the winners of the School Library Association Information Book Award). The day is used by libraries, schools, literacy organisations, book reviewers and parents to highlight the best information and narrative non fiction books for children, and to show how it's not just fiction that can be read and enjoyed for pleasure. Each year there is a different theme to the day.
Signor Bonaventura is an Italian comic strip created in 1917 by actor and playwright Sergio Tofano. It is considered among the most famous and successful comic strips ever created in Italy. The character made his first appearance on October 28, 1917 in the issue 43 of the "Corriere dei Piccoli", the supplement for children of "Corriere della Sera". It was a full page comic strip composed of eight vignettes, each accompanied by a text in verse. From that moment Bonaventura appeared continuously every week for 26 years, until 1943. After the war publications were resumed, only to be reduced gradually during the fifties and to be discontinued in the sixties. Then, after the death of Tofano, the character was taken over by his son, Gilberto Tofano, and by cartoonist Carlo Peroni. Most of the adventures of "Signor Bonaventura" end with him receiving a 1 million (and, later, 1 billion) lire check for various reasons. This is lampshaded by his name itself, whose etymology comes from "bona", which means "good", and "ventura", which (in this context) means "things to come"; see the page on the Italian Wikipedia about the for further details on the etymology. "Signor" simply refers to the male gender of the character, thus literally meaning "mister". Media. Signor Bonaventura was protagonist of several plays written and performed by Sergio Tofano between 1927 and 1953. The character was also adapted by Paolo Poli in 1966 in the play "Un milione". In 1941 the same Tofano directed a film adaptation of the comic strips, "Princess Cinderella" ("Cenerentola e il signor Bonaventura"), in which the main character was played by Paolo Stoppa.

The 2012 FIA WTCC Race of Slovakia was the fourth round of the 2012 World Touring Car Championship season and the maiden running of the FIA WTCC Race of Slovakia. It was held on 29 April 2012 at the Automotodr m Slovakia Ring in Orechov Pot , Slovakia. The first race was won by Gabriele Tarquini for Lukoil Racing Team and the second race was won by Robert Huff for Chevrolet. Background. Chevrolet came to Slovakia on the back of winning the first six races of the season, with Yvan Muller leading the championship 24 points ahead of Alain Menu. Pepe Oriola was leading the Yokohama Independents' Trophy. G bor W ber returned with Zeng Motorsport after missing the previous round in Morocco due to cost concerns. Isaac Tutumlu sat out the Race of Slovakia after his Proteam Racing team failed to repair his car in time after damage was sustained in Marrakech. SUNRED Engineering's Andrea Barlesi was unable to continue in the World Touring Car Championship after Marrakech with his budget having run out. Report. Free practice. Oriola was the quickest driver in the opening practice session on Friday, ahead of the Lukoil SEAT Le n of Tarquini and the Team Aon Ford Focus of James Nash. The session was briefly red flagged when the engine in Tiago Monteiro's Le n cut out. It was Chevrolet's turn to top the times in the second free practice sessions, with Menu topping the times ahead of Yvan Muller. After the session had ended, Tarquini beached his car in the gravel having finished the session tenth fastest. Qualifying. Norbert Michelisz took his first WTCC pole position to beat the Lukoil Racing Team drivers of Aleksei Dudukalo in second and Tarquini in third. A red flag towards the end of Q1 for Franz Engstler's stranded BMW 320 TC prevented Tom Coronel from progressing into the second session. Nash, who had qualified a career best fourth, failed a ride height check in post qualifying scrutineering and was dropped ten places on the grid for both races. Warm up. Muller led the Sunday morning warm up session with Nash second, Huff third and Oriola fourth. Race one. Michelisz led into the first corner but contact with second placed Tarquini would drop him down the order, and further contact with Muller dropped him down to sixth and earned the Chevrolet driver a drive through penalty. Oriola had briefly climbed into second place before a puncture and the subsequent trip into the gravel ended his challenge. Tarquini led a Lukoil Racing Team 1 2 finish the chequered flag with Menu third for Chevrolet. Dudukalo was the winning driver in the Yokohama Independents' Trophy. Race two. Stefano D'Aste started on the reversed grid pole and led down into turn one. The Chevrolet trio and Tarquini took the lead when the Wiechers Sport driver ran wide. Dudukalo was issued with a drive through penalty for failing to have all four wheels on his car on the ground when the five minute board was shown before the race. Huff led Muller and Menu until Tarquini took his third place. ROAL Motorsport's Tom Coronel also overtook Menu before the Swiss retired with a broken rim. Huff took his first win of the year ahead of Muller and Tarquini, with Oriola the winner in the Yokohama Independents' Trophy.
The rum ration (also called tot) was a daily amount of rum given to sailors on Royal Navy ships. It was abolished in 1970 after concerns that regular intakes of alcohol would lead to unsteady hands when working machinery. Tradition. The rum ration, or "tot", from 1850 to 1970 consisted of of rum at 95.5 proof (54.6% ABV), given out to every sailor at midday. Senior ratings (petty officers and above) received their rum neat, whilst for junior ratings it was diluted with two parts of water to make of grog. The rum ration was served from one particular barrel, also known as the "Rum Tub", which was ornately decorated and was made of oak and reinforced with brass bands with brass letters saying "The Queen, God Bless Her". Not all sailors necessarily drew their rum: each had the option to be marked in the ship's books as "G" (for Grog) or "T" (for Temperance, if they were members of the Temperance Movement and do not drink alcohol). Sailors who opted to be "T" were given three pence (3d) a day instead of the rum ration, although most preferred the rum. Sailors under 20 were not permitted a rum ration, and were marked on the ship's books as "UA" (Under Age). The time when the rum ration was distributed was called "Up Spirits", which was between 11 am and 12 noon. A common cry from the sailors was "Stand fast the Holy Ghost". This was in response to the bosun's call "Up Spirits". Each mess had a "Rum Bosun" who would collect the rum from the officer responsible for measuring the right number of tots for each mess. The officers did not get a rum ration. Tot glasses were kept separate from any other glasses. They were washed on the outside, but never inside, in the belief that residue of past tots would stick to the side of the glass and make the tot even stronger. History. A sailor's ration of alcohol was originally beer with a daily ration of one gallon (i.e. eight pints). This official allowance continued until after the Napoleonic Wars. When beer was not available, as it would often spoil easily, it could be substituted by a pint of wine or half a pint of spirits depending on what was locally available. In later years, the political influence of the West Indian planters led to rum being given the preference over arrack and other spirits. The half pint of spirits was originally issued neat; it is said that sailors would "prove" its strength by checking that gunpowder doused with rum would still burn (thus verifying that rum was at least 57% ABV). The practice of compulsorily diluting rum in the proportion of half a pint to one quart of water (1:4) was first introduced in the 1740s by Admiral Edward Vernon (known as Old Grog, because of his habitual grogram cloak). The ration was also split into two servings, one between 10 am and noon and the other between 4 and 6 pm. In 1795 Navy regulations required adding small quantities of lemon or lime juice to the ration, to prevent scurvy, as per Vernon's instruction that members of the crew "which ... are good husbandmen may from the saving of their salt provisions and bread, purchase sugar and limes to make it more palatable to them."[1] The rum itself was often procured from distillers in Jamaica, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and the British Virgin Islands. Rations were cut in half in 1823 and again in half, to the traditional amount, in 1850. The abolition of the rum ration had been discussed in Parliament in 1850 and again in 1881 however nothing came of it. In 1970, Admiral Peter Hill Norton abolished the rum ration as he felt it could have led to sailors failing a breathalyser test and being less capable to manage complex machinery. This decision to end the rum ration was made after the Secretary of State for Defence had taken opinions from several ranks of the Navy. Ratings were instead allowed to purchase beer, and the amount allowed was determined, according to the MP David Owen, by the amount of space available for stowing the extra beer in ships. The last rum ration was on 31 July 1970 and became known as Black Tot Day as sailors were unhappy about the loss of the rum ration. There were reports that the day involved sailors throwing tots into the sea and the staging of a mock funeral in a training camp. In place of the rum ration, sailors were allowed to buy three cans of beer a day and improved recreational facilities. While the rum ration was abolished, the order to "splice the mainbrace", awarding sailors an extra tot of rum for good service, remained as a command which could only be given by the Monarch and is still used to recognise good service. Rum rations are also given on special occasions: in recent years, example included the 100th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy in 2010 and after the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. In other navies. In the United States Navy, the daily ration was of distilled spirits until 1842, when it was reduced to . It was abolished in 1862. While the Royal Australian Navy never issued the rum ration, their sailors were entitled to the rum ration when they were on Royal Navy ships until 1921. The Royal Canadian Navy abolished the rum ration in 1972, and the last navy to issue the rum ration regularly, the Royal New Zealand Navy, abolished the practice on 28 February 1990.
The Stadsleenbank Delft is a former Bank van Lening on the Burgwal 45 in Delft, and serves today as a pop music podium for concerts. The gable stone is inscribed '1769 Den Ingangh van de Stadsleenbanck', whereby "Den Ingangh" means entrance. Delft first received rights for a city lombard or "lommerd" bank in 1287 from Floris V. In 1367 similar rights "as in Delft" were granted to Haarlem by Albert I, Duke of Bavaria. The Lombard bankers sold out to the city council in 1676, and the bank functioned until 1923 when it was dissolved. The archives 1676 1923 were only partially retained and were inventoried in 1970 and are today in the collection of the city of Delft.

In molecular biology, the protein domain WHEP TRS refers to helix turn helix domains. They are found in variable numbers in a particularly common protein, named, glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase(EPRS). This protein domain has an important function in protein protein interactions between synthetases. WHEP domains exhibit high affinity interactions with tRNA, indicating a putative evolutionary relationship to facilitate tRNA binding to fused synthetases, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency. Protein interactions. EPRS is a component of the interferon gamma activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex, which interacts with stem loop elements (GAIT elements) in mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). WHEP domains interact with the GAIT element in the 3 UTR of target mRNAs and with the regulatory protein NS1 associated protein 1 (NSAP1). Structure. A conserved domain of 46 amino acids, called WHEP TRS has been shown to exist in a number of higher eukaryote aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases. This domain is present one to six times in several enzymes. There are three copies in mammalian aminoacyl tRNA synthetase in a region that separates the N terminal glutamyl tRNA synthetase domain from the C terminal prolyl tRNA synthetase domain, and six copies in the intercatalytic region of the Drosophila enzyme. The domain is found at the N terminal extremity of the mammalian tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase and histidyl tRNA synthetase, and the mammalian, insect, nematode and plant glycyl tRNA synthetases.
Beersville is a small community in Weldford Parish located 3.92 km SSE of Fords Mills and was named for John A. Beers (1860 1951) The community had a Post Office from 1900 to 1965 and in 1904 Beersville was a station on the Intercolonial Railway and a farming settlement with 1 post office, 1 store, 1 sawmill, 1 church and a population of 100. At one point it was a part of Emerson, at another, Emerson was a separate community but the place name was removed and the name is now honoured in the area by a road through Beersville called Emerson Road.

The Classification of European Inland Waterways is a set of standards for interoperability of large navigable waterways forming part of the Trans European Inland Waterway network within Continental Europe and Russia. It was created by the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT; , ) in 1992, hence the range of dimensions are also referred to as CEMT Class I VII. The size for each waterway is limited by the dimensions of the structures including the locks and boat lifts on the route. Classification. Class I corresponds to the historical Freycinet gauge decreed in France during 1879. The larger river classification sizes are focused on the carriage of intermodal containers in convoys of barges propelled by a push tug.

are historic Japanese distance markers akin to milestones. Comprising a pair of earthen mounds ("tsuka" or "zuka") covered in trees and flanking the road, they denoted the distance in "ri" () to Nihonbashi, the "Bridge of Japan", erected in Edo in 1603. "Ichirizuka" were encountered and described by Engelbert Kaempfer, c.1690: "serving as a milestone are two hills, facing each other, which are raised up on both sides of the road, and planted with one or more trees." Establishment. The Tokugawa shogunate established "ichirizuka" on the major roads in 1604, enabling calculation both of distance travelled and of the charge for transportation by kago or palanquin. These mounds, to be maintained by "post stations and local villages", were one component of the developing road infrastructure, which also included bridges and ferries; post stations (both shukuba, and the more informal ai no shuku); and tea houses (chaya). However, the main aim was "official mobility, not recreational travelling": the movement of farmers and women was discouraged, and a system of passports and maintained. By marking the distance from Edo rather than Kyoto, establishing a symbolic point of origin for all movements, the Tokugawa made of mile markers what they would later make of checkpoints: powerful reminders of the government's geopolitical ubiquity and efficacious tools in its appropriation of space. "Ichirizuka" were important enough to be found on the well known "Proportional Map of the Tokaido" by printmaker Hishikawa Moronobu (d. 1694). A traditional poem allegorically compares the "ichirizuka" that mark distance to the "Kadomatsu" marking the years of a person's life. Survival. With the modernization of Japan in the Meiji period, many of the mounds disappeared through road widening and construction schemes, and the survival of both is now rare. Of "ichirizuka" that are still extant, sixteen have been designated for protection as national Historic Sites. Of the two within Tokyo, that at Nishigahara was once threatened by a road widening project; a movement to save it led by industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi, the "father of Japanese capitalism", is commemorated in a monument beside what is now .

International Association of Byzantine Studies (, AIEB) was launched in 1948. It is an international co ordinating body that links national Byzantine Studies member groups. Background and Activities. The AIEB was established in 1948 as an outgrowth of various international Byzantine Studies congresses with the goal of coordinating activities amongst different local and regional Byzantine Studies associations. Since 1964, it has published a bulletin, the "Bulletin d'information et de coordination," and in 2017, it began releasing a monthly newsletter, "Byzantine News." The AIEB also oversees a number of commissions that support and promote areas of specialised research. Such commissions include the Corpus Fontinum Historiae Byzantinae, Inscriptiones Graecae Aevi Byzantini, the AIEB Development Commission, the Commission for the History of Byzantine Art, the Commission for the Historical Geography and Spatial Analysis of Byzantium, the Commission for Byzantine Archaeology, and the Commission for Byzantine Sigillography. Leadership. Former and current presidents and honorary presidents of the AIEB include: Participating National Committees. Current national members of the AIEB include:
Changuimun (Hangul , Hanja ; also known as Northwest Gate) is one of the Eight Gates of Seoul in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, South Korea, which surrounded the city in the Joseon Dynasty. The gate is also known as Buksomun ( , North Small Gate ), and Jahamun ( ). History. Changuimun was originally built in 1396. Along with Hyehwamun (the Northeast Gate), Changuimun served as a major portal for those exiting the walled city of Seoul, then known as Hanyang ( , ) to travel north. (Sukjeongmun, the North Gate, had a largely ceremonious function.) The wooden gatehouse above Changuimun was burned down during the 16th century invasions by Japan, but was rebuilt in 1740 or 1741. The gatehouse is currently the oldest gatehouse of those on the Four Small Gates ( ) in the Fortress Wall of Seoul. The name Changuimun means literally Showing the Correct Thing Gate. The Gate today. Changuimun is located in Jongno gu, Buam dong, Seoul. It can be accessed easily via taking subway line 1 to Jonggak Station exit 3, then taking bus 7022 at Jeil Bank, and getting off at Jahamun Tunnel. Visitors to the gate today are allowed access to the front and the back of the gate, and under the gate itself. Visitors may also carefully view the wooden gatehouse above the gate, but are not allowed inside, and should not approach too closely due to a laser alarm system (July 2012). If approaching the gate from the west, visitors notice there is a gate like tunnel leading up to the gate itself. (See image below.) The gate is known for being in a very early state of preservation, compared with the rest of the Eight Gates of Seoul. The wooden rafters on the interior of the gate are decorated with chickens, which were known as enemies of the centipede. This is in contrast to Hyehwamun, whose rafters are decorated with the phoenix, enemies of small birds. Very close to Changuimun are memorials to two people who lost their lives defending South Korea during the Blue House Raid on January 21, 1968: Superintendent General Choi Gyu sik (see image below); and the Assistant Inspector Officer, Jung Jong su. Visitors can walk through the passageway to view gate. People are allowed to go up the stairs.
Induced stem cells (iSC) are stem cells derived from somatic, reproductive, pluripotent or other cell types by deliberate epigenetic reprogramming. They are classified as either totipotent (iTC), pluripotent (iPSC) or progenitor (multipotent iMSC, also called an induced multipotent progenitor cell iMPC) or unipotent (iUSC) according to their developmental potential and degree of dedifferentiation. Progenitors are obtained by so called direct reprogramming or directed differentiation and are also called induced somatic stem cells. Three techniques are widely recognized: Natural processes. In 1895 Thomas Morgan removed one of a frog's two blastomeres and found that amphibians are able to form whole embryos from the remaining part. This meant that the cells can change their differentiation pathway. In 1924 Spemann and Mangold demonstrated the key importance of cell cell inductions during animal development. The reversible transformation of cells of one differentiated cell type to another is called metaplasia. This transition can be a part of the normal maturation process, or caused by an inducement. One example is the transformation of iris cells to lens cells in the process of maturation and transformation of retinal pigment epithelium cells into the neural retina during regeneration in adult newt eyes. This process allows the body to replace cells not suitable to new conditions with more suitable new cells. In Drosophila imaginal discs, cells have to choose from a limited number of standard discrete differentiation states. The fact that transdetermination (change of the path of differentiation) often occurs for a group of cells rather than single cells shows that it is induced rather than part of maturation. The researchers were able to identify the minimal conditions and factors that would be sufficient for starting the cascade of molecular and cellular processes to instruct pluripotent cells to organize the embryo. They showed that opposing gradients of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Nodal, two transforming growth factor family members that act as morphogens, are sufficient to induce molecular and cellular mechanisms required to organize, "in vivo" or "in vitro", uncommitted cells of the zebrafish blastula animal pole into a well developed embryo. Some types of mature, specialized adult cells can naturally revert to stem cells. For example, "chief" cells express the stem cell marker Troy. While they normally produce digestive fluids for the stomach, they can revert into stem cells to make temporary repairs to stomach injuries, such as a cut or damage from infection. Moreover, they can make this transition even in the absence of noticeable injuries and are capable of replenishing entire gastric units, in essence serving as quiescent "reserve" stem cells. Differentiated airway epithelial cells can revert into stable and functional stem cells in vivo. After injury, mature terminally differentiated kidney cells dedifferentiate into more primordial versions of themselves and then differentiate into the cell types needing replacement in the damaged tissue Macrophages can self renew by local proliferation of mature differentiated cells. In newts, muscle tissue is regenerated from specialized muscle cells that dedifferentiate and forget the type of cell they had been. This capacity to regenerate does not decline with age and may be linked to their ability to make new stem cells from muscle cells on demand. A variety of nontumorigenic stem cells display the ability to generate multiple cell types. For instance, multilineage differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells are stress tolerant adult human stem cells that can self renew. They form characteristic cell clusters in suspension culture that express a set of genes associated with pluripotency and can differentiate into endodermal, ectodermal and mesodermal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Other well documented examples of transdifferentiation and their significance in development and regeneration were described in detail. Induced totipotent cells. SCNT mediated. Induced totipotent cells can be obtained by reprogramming somatic cells with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The process involves sucking out the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell and injecting it into an oocyte that has had its nucleus removed Using an approach based on the protocol outlined by Tachibana et al., hESCs can be generated by SCNT using dermal fibroblasts nuclei from both a middle aged 35 year old male and an elderly, 75 year old male, suggesting that age associated changes are not necessarily an impediment to SCNT based nuclear reprogramming of human cells. Such reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state holds huge potentials for regenerative medicine. Unfortunately, the cells generated by this technology are potentially not completely protected from the immune system of the patient (donor of nuclei), because they have the same mitochondrial DNA, as a donor of oocytes, instead of the patients mitochondrial DNA. This reduces their value as a source for autologous stem cell transplantation therapy; as for the present, it is not clear whether it can induce an immune response of the patient upon treatment. Induced androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells can be used instead of sperm for cloning. These cells, synchronized in M phase and injected into the oocyte, can produce viable offspring. These developments, together with data on the possibility of unlimited oocytes from mitotically active reproductive stem cells, offer the possibility of industrial production of transgenic farm animals. Repeated recloning of viable mice through a SCNT method that includes a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin, added to the cell culture medium, show that it may be possible to reclone animals indefinitely with no visible accumulation of reprogramming or genomic errors However, research into technologies to develop sperm and egg cells from stem cells raises bioethical issues. Such technologies may also have far reaching clinical applications for overcoming cytoplasmic defects in human oocytes. For example, the technology could prevent inherited mitochondrial disease from passing to future generations. Mitochondrial genetic material is passed from mother to child. Mutations can cause diabetes, deafness, eye disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, heart disease, dementia, and other neurological diseases. The nucleus from one human egg has been transferred to another, including its mitochondria, creating a cell that could be regarded as having two mothers. The eggs were then fertilised and the resulting embryonic stem cells carried the swapped mitochondrial DNA. As evidence that the technique is safe, the author of this method points to the existence of the healthy monkeys that are now more than four years old and are the product of mitochondrial transplants across different genetic backgrounds. In late generation telomerase deficient (Terc / ) mice, SCNT mediated reprogramming mitigates telomere dysfunction and mitochondrial defects to a greater extent than iPSC based reprogramming. Other cloning and totipotent transformation achievements have been described. Obtained without SCNT. Recently, some researchers succeeded in getting totipotent cells without the aid of SCNT. Totipotent cells were obtained using epigenetic factors such as oocyte germinal isoform of histone. Reprogramming in vivo, by transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c Myc in mice, confers totipotency features. Intraperitoneal injection of such in vivo iPS cells generates embryo like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic (trophectodermal) markers. The developmental potential of mouse pluripotent stem cells to yield both embryonic and extra embryonic lineages also can be expanded by microRNA miR 34a deficiency, leading to strong induction of endogenous retroviruses MuERV L (MERVL). Rejuvenation to iPSCs. iPSc were first obtained in the form of transplantable teratocarcinoma induced by grafts taken from mouse embryos. Teratocarcinoma formed from somatic cells. Genetically mosaic mice were obtained from malignant teratocarcinoma cells, confirming the cells' pluripotency. It turned out that teratocarcinoma cells are able to maintain a culture of pluripotent embryonic stem cell in an undifferentiated state, by supplying the culture medium with various factors. In the 1980s, it became clear that transplanting pluripotent/embryonic stem cells into the body of adult mammals, usually leads to the formation of teratomas, which can then turn into a malignant tumor teratocarcinoma. However, putting teratocarcinoma cells into the embryo at the blastocyst stage caused them to become incorporated in the inner cell mass and often produced a normal chimeric (i.e. composed of cells from different organisms) animal. This indicated that the cause of the teratoma is a dissonance mutual miscommunication between young donor cells and surrounding adult cells (the recipient's so called "niche"). In August 2006, Japanese researchers circumvented the need for an oocyte, as in SCNT. By reprograming mouse embryonic fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells via the ectopic expression of four transcription factors, namely Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c Myc, they proved that the overexpression of a small number of factors can push the cell to transition to a new stable state that is associated with changes in the activity of thousands of genes. Reprogramming mechanisms are thus linked, rather than independent, and are centered on a small number of genes. IPSC properties are very similar to ESCs. iPSCs have been shown to support the development of all iPSC mice using a tetraploid (4n) embryo, the most stringent assay for developmental potential. However, some genetically normal iPSCs failed to produce all iPSC mice because of aberrant epigenetic silencing of the imprinted Dlk1 Dio3 gene cluster. A team headed by Hans Sch ler (who discovered the Oct4 gene back in 1989) showed that Oct4 overexpression drives massive off target gene activation during reprogramming deteriorating the quality of iPSCs. Compared to OSKM (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c Myc) that show abnormal imprinting and differentiation patterns, SKM (Sox2, Klf4 and c Myc) reprogramming generates iPSCs with high developmental potential (nearly 20 fold higher than that of OSKM) equivalent to embryonic stem cell, as determined by their ability to generate all iPSC mice through tetraploid embryo complementation. An important advantage of iPSC over ESC is that they can be derived from adult cells, rather than from embryos. Therefore, it becomes possible to obtain iPSC from adult and even elderly patients. Reprogramming somatic cells into iPSCs leads to rejuvenation. It was found that reprogramming leads to telomere lengthening and subsequent shortening after their differentiation back into fibroblast like derivatives. Thus, reprogramming leads to the restoration of embryonic telomere length, and hence increases the potential number of cell divisions otherwise limited by the Hayflick limit. However, because of the dissonance between rejuvenated cells and the surrounding niche of the recipient's older cells, the injection of his own iPSC usually leads to an immune response, which can be used for medical purposes, or the formation of tumors such as teratoma. A hypothesized reason is that some cells differentiated from ESCs and iPSCs in vivo continue to synthesize embryonic protein isoforms. So, the immune system might detect and attack cells that are not cooperating properly. A small molecule called MitoBloCK 6 can force the pluripotent stem cells to die by triggering apoptosis (via cytochrome c release across the mitochondrial outer membrane) in human pluripotent stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. Shortly after differentiation, daughter cells became resistant to death. When MitoBloCK 6 was introduced to differentiated cell lines, the cells remained healthy. The key to their survival was hypothesized to be due to the changes undergone by pluripotent stem cell mitochondria in the process of cell differentiation. This ability of MitoBloCK 6 to separate the pluripotent and differentiated cell lines has the potential to reduce the risk of teratomas and other problems in regenerative medicine. In 2012, other small molecules (selective cytotoxic inhibitors of human pluripotent stem cells hPSCs) were identified that prevented human pluripotent stem cells from forming teratomas in mice. The most potent and selective compound of them (PluriSIn #1) inhibits stearoyl coA desaturase (the key enzyme in oleic acid biosynthesis), which finally results in apoptosis. With the help of this molecule, the undifferentiated cells can be selectively removed from culture. An efficient strategy to selectively eliminate pluripotent cells with teratoma potential is targeting pluripotent stem cell specific antiapoptotic factor(s) (i.e., survivin or Bcl10). A single treatment with chemical survivin inhibitors (e.g., quercetin or YM155) can induce selective and complete cell death of undifferentiated hPSCs and is claimed to be sufficient to prevent teratoma formation after transplantation. However, it is unlikely that any kind of preliminary clearance is able to secure the replanting of iPSCs or ESCs. After the selective removal of pluripotent cells, they re emerge quickly by reverting differentiated cells into stem cells, which leads to tumors. This may be due to the disorder of let 7 regulation of its target Nr6a1 (also known as Germ cell nuclear factor GCNF), an embryonic transcriptional repressor of pluripotency genes that regulates gene expression in adult fibroblasts following micro RNA miRNA loss. Teratoma formation by pluripotent stem cells may be caused by low activity of PTEN enzyme, reported to promote the survival of a small population (0.1 5% of total population) of highly tumorigenic, aggressive, teratoma initiating embryonic like carcinoma cells during differentiation. The survival of these teratoma initiating cells is associated with failed repression of Nanog, as well as a propensity for increased glucose and cholesterol metabolism. These teratoma initiating cells also expressed a lower ratio of p53/p21 when compared to non tumorigenic cells. In connection with the above safety problems, the use of iPSCs for cell therapy is still limited. However, they can be used for a variety of other purposes, including the modeling of disease, screening (selective selection) of drugs, and toxicity testing of various drugs. The tissue grown from iPSCs, placed in the "chimeric" embryos in the early stages of mouse development, practically do not cause an immune response (after the embryos have grown into adult mice) and are suitable for autologous transplantation At the same time, full reprogramming of adult cells in vivo within tissues by transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c Myc in mice results in teratomas emerging from multiple organs. Furthermore, partial reprogramming of cells toward pluripotency in vivo in mice demonstrates that incomplete reprogramming entails epigenetic changes (failed repression of Polycomb targets and altered DNA methylation) in cells that drive cancer development. However, a number of researchers later managed to carry out cyclical partial reprogramming "in vivo" by expression of the Yamanaka factors for a short period of time without subsequent carcinogenesis, thus partially rejuvenating and extending lifespan in progeroid mice. With "in vitro" method employing slightly longer periods of reprogramming (to substantially rejuvenate) cells temporarily lose their cell identity but "reacquire their initial somatic fate when the reprogramming factors are withdrawn". Chemical inducement. By using solely small molecules, Deng Hongkui and colleagues demonstrated that endogenous "master genes" are enough for cell fate reprogramming. They induced a pluripotent state in adult cells from mice using seven small molecule compounds. The method's effectiveness is quite high: it was able to convert 0.02% of the adult tissue cells into iPSCs, which is comparable to the gene insertion conversion rate. The authors note that the mice generated from CiPSCs were "100% viable and apparently healthy for up to 6 months". So, this chemical reprogramming strategy has potential use in generating functional desirable cell types for clinical applications. In 2015 a robust chemical reprogramming system was established with a yield up to 1,000 fold greater than that of the previously reported protocol. So, chemical reprogramming became a promising approach to manipulate cell fates. Differentiation from induced teratoma. The fact that human iPSCs are capable of forming teratomas not only in humans but also in some animal body, in particular mice or pigs, allowed researchers to develop a method for differentiation of iPSCs in vivo. For this purpose, iPSCs with an agent for inducing differentiation into target cells are injected to a genetically modified pig or mouse that has suppressed immune system activation on human cells. The formed teratoma is cut out and used for the isolation of the necessary differentiated human cells by means of monoclonal antibody to tissue specific markers on the surface of these cells. This method has been successfully used for the production of functional myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid human cells suitable for transplantation (yet only to mice). Mice engrafted with human iPSC teratoma derived hematopoietic cells produced human B and T cells capable of functional immune responses. These results offer hope that in vivo generation of patient customized cells is feasible, providing materials that could be useful for transplantation, human antibody generation, and drug screening applications. Using MitoBloCK 6 and/or PluriSIn # 1 the differentiated progenitor cells can be further purified from teratoma forming pluripotent cells. The fact that the differentiation takes place even in the teratoma niche offers hope that the resulting cells are sufficiently stable to stimuli able to cause their transition back to the dedifferentiated (pluripotent) state and therefore safe. A similar in vivo differentiation system, yielding engraftable hematopoietic stem cells from mouse and human iPSCs in teratoma bearing animals in combination with a maneuver to facilitate hematopoiesis, was described by Suzuki et al. They noted that neither leukemia nor tumors were observed in recipients after intravenous injection of iPSC derived hematopoietic stem cells into irradiated recipients. Moreover, this injection resulted in multilineage and long term reconstitution of the hematolymphopoietic system in serial transfers. Such a system provides a useful tool for practical application of iPSCs in the treatment of hematologic and immunologic diseases. For further development of this method, animals (such as a mice) in which the human cell graft is grown must have modified genome such that all its cells express and have on its surface human SIRP . To prevent rejection after transplantation to the patient of the allogenic organ or tissue, grown from the pluripotent stem cells in vivo in the animal, these cells should express two molecules: CTLA4 Ig, which disrupts T cell costimulatory pathways and PD L1, which activates T cell inhibitory pathway. See also: . Differentiated cell types. Retinal cells. In the near future, clinical trials designed to demonstrate the safety of the use of iPSCs for cell therapy of people with age related macular degeneration, a disease causing blindness through retina damaging, will begin. There are several articles describing methods for producing retinal cells from iPSCs and how to use them for cell therapy. Reports of iPSC derived retinal pigmented epithelium transplantation showed enhanced visual guided behaviors of experimental animals for 6 weeks after transplantation. However, clinical trials have been successful: ten patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa have had eyesight restored, including a woman who had only 17 percent of her vision left. Lung and airway epithelial cells. Chronic lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a considerable human, societal, and financial burden. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective cell therapy and lung tissue engineering. Several protocols have been developed for generation of most cell types of the respiratory system, which may be useful for deriving patient specific therapeutic cells. Reproductive cells. Some lines of iPSCs have the potential to differentiate into male germ cells and oocyte like cells in an appropriate niche (by culturing in retinoic acid and porcine follicular fluid differentiation medium or seminiferous tubule transplantation). Moreover, iPSC transplantation contributes to repairing the testis of infertile mice, demonstrating the potential of gamete derivation from iPSCs in vivo and in vitro. Induced progenitor stem cells. Direct transdifferentiation. The risk of cancer and tumors creates the need to develop methods for safer cell lines suitable for clinical use. An alternative approach is so called "direct reprogramming" transdifferentiation of cells without passing through the pluripotent state. The basis for this approach was that 5 azacytidine a DNA demethylation reagent can cause the formation of myogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogeni clones in an immortal cell line of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and that the activation of a single gene, later named MyoD1, is sufficient for such reprogramming. Compared with iPSCs whose reprogramming requires at least two weeks, the formation of induced progenitor cells sometimes occurs within a few days and the efficiency of reprogramming is usually many times higher. This reprogramming does not always require cell division. The cells resulting from such reprogramming are more suitable for cell therapy because they do not form teratomas. For example, Chandrakanthan et al., &amp; Pimanda describe the generation of tissue regenerative multipotent stem cells (iMS cells) by treating mature bone and fat cells transiently with a growth factor (platelet derived growth factor AB (PDGF AB)) and 5 Azacytidine. These authors state that "Unlike primary mesenchymal stem cells, which are used with little objective evidence in clinical practice to promote tissue repair, iMS cells contribute directly to in vivo tissue regeneration in a context dependent manner without forming tumors" and thus "has significant scope for application in tissue regeneration". Single transcription factor transdifferentiation. Originally, only early embryonic cells could be coaxed into changing their identity. Mature cells are resistant to changing their identity once they've committed to a specific kind. However, brief expression of a single transcription factor, the ELT 7 GATA factor, can convert the identity of fully differentiated, specialized non endodermal cells of the pharynx into fully differentiated intestinal cells in intact larvae and adult roundworm "Caenorhabditis elegans" with no requirement for a dedifferentiated intermediate. Transdifferentiation with CRISPR mediated activator. The cell fate can be effectively manipulated by epigenome editing, in particular via the direct activation of specific endogenous gene expression with CRISPR mediated activator. When dCas9 (which has been modified so that it no longer cuts DNA, but still can be guided to specific sequences and to bind to them) is combined with transcription activators, it can precisely manipulate endogenous gene expression. Using this method, Wei et al., enhanced the expression of endogenous Cdx2 and Gata6 genes by CRISPR mediated activators, thus directly converting mouse embryonic stem cells into two extraembryonic lineages, i.e., typical trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm cells. An analogous approach was used to induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l genes to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufficient for conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification. Phased process modeling regeneration. Another way of reprogramming is the simulation of processes that occur during amphibian limb regeneration. In urodele amphibians, an early step in limb regeneration is skeletal muscle fiber dedifferentiation into a cellulate that proliferates into limb tissue. However, sequential small molecule treatment of the muscle fiber with myoseverin, reversine (the aurora B kinase inhibitor), and some other chemicals (BIO (glycogen synthase 3 kinase inhibitor), lysophosphatidic acid (pleiotropic activator of G protein coupled receptors), SB203580 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor), or SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor)) causes the formation of new muscle cell types as well as other cell types such as precursors to fat, bone, and nervous system cells. Antibody based transdifferentiation. The researchers discovered that GCSF mimicking antibody can activate a growth stimulating receptor on marrow cells in a way that induces marrow stem cells which normally develop into white blood cells to become neural progenitor cells. The technique enables researchers to search large libraries of antibodies and quickly select the ones with a desired biological effect. Reprograming by bacteria. The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a vast community of symbionts and commensals. The researchers demonstrate the phenomenon of somatic cell reprograming by bacteria and generation of multipotential cells from adult human dermal fibroblast cells by incorporating Lactic acid bacteria This cellular transdifferentiation is caused by ribosomes and "can occur via donor bacteria that are swallowed and digested by host cells, which may induce ribosomal stress and stimulate cellular developmental plasticity". Conditionally reprogrammed cells. Schlegel and Liu demonstrated that the combination of feeder cells and a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y 27632) induces normal and tumor epithelial cells from many tissues to proliferate indefinitely in vitro. This process occurs without the need for transduction of exogenous viral or cellular genes. These cells have been termed "Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC)". The induction of CRCs is rapid and results from reprogramming of the entire cell population. CRCs do not express high levels of proteins characteristic of iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (e.g., Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4). This induction of CRCs is reversible and removal of Y 27632 and feeders allows the cells to differentiate normally. CRC technology can generate 2 cells in 5 to 6 days from needle biopsies and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. CRCs retain a normal karyotype and remain nontumorigenic. This technique also efficiently establishes cell cultures from human and rodent tumors. The ability to rapidly generate many tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue provides significant opportunities for cell based diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity testing) and greatly expands the value of biobanking. Using CRC technology, researchers were able to identify an effective therapy for a patient with a rare type of lung tumor. Engleman's group describes a pharmacogenomic platform that facilitates rapid discovery of drug combinations which can overcome resistance using CRC system. In addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic manipulation of epithelial cells ex vivo and their subsequent evaluation in vivo in the same host. While initial studies revealed that co culturing epithelial cells with Swiss 3T3 cells J2 was essential for CRC induction, with transwell culture plates, physical contact between feeders and epithelial cells isn't required for inducing CRCs, and more importantly, irradiation of the feeder cells is required for this induction. Consistent with the transwell experiments, conditioned medium induces and maintains CRCs, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase of cellular telomerase activity. The activity of the conditioned medium correlates directly with radiation induced feeder cell apoptosis. Thus, conditional reprogramming of epithelial cells is mediated by a combination of Y 27632 and a soluble factor(s) released by apoptotic feeder cells. Riegel et al. demonstrate that mouse ME cells, isolated from normal mammary glands or from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) Neu induced mammary tumors, can be cultured indefinitely as conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs). Cell surface progenitor associated markers are rapidly induced in normal mouse ME CRCs relative to ME cells. However, the expression of certain mammary progenitor subpopulations, such as CD49f+ ESA+ CD44+, drops significantly in later passages. Nevertheless, mouse ME CRCs grown in a three dimensional extracellular matrix gave rise to mammary acinar structures. ME CRCs isolated from MMTV Neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors express high levels of HER2/neu, as well as tumor initiating cell markers, such as CD44+, CD49f+, and ESA+ (EpCam). These patterns of expression are sustained in later CRC passages. Early and late passage ME CRCs from MMTV Neu tumors that were implanted in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic or nude mice developed vascular tumors that metastasized within 6 weeks of transplantation. Importantly, the histopathology of these tumors was indistinguishable from that of the parental tumors that develop in the MMTV Neu mice. Application of the CRC system to mouse mammary epithelial cells provides an attractive model system to study genetics and phenotype of normal and transformed mouse epithelium in a defined culture environment and in in vivo transplant studies. A different approach to CRC is to inhibit CD47 a membrane protein that is the thrombospondin 1 receptor. Loss of CD47 permits sustained proliferation of primary murine endothelial cells, increases asymmetric division, and enables these cells to spontaneously reprogram to form multipotent embryoid body like clusters. CD47 knockdown acutely increases mRNA levels of c Myc and other stem cell transcription factors in cells in vitro and in vivo. Thrombospondin 1 is a key environmental signal that inhibits stem cell self renewal via CD47. Thus, CD47 antagonists enable cell self renewal and reprogramming by overcoming negative regulation of c Myc and other stem cell transcription factors. In vivo blockade of CD47 using an antisense morpholino increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation due to increased proliferative capacity of bone marrow derived cells and radioprotection of radiosensitive gastrointestinal tissues. Lineage specific enhancers. Differentiated macrophages can self renew in tissues and expand long term in culture. Under certain conditions, macrophages can divide without losing features they have acquired while specializing into immune cells which is usually not possible with differentiated cells. The macrophages achieve this by activating a gene network similar to one found in embryonic stem cells. Single cell analysis revealed that, "in vivo", proliferating macrophages can derepress a macrophage specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network controlling self renewal. This happened when concentrations of two transcription factors named MafB and c Maf were naturally low or were inhibited for a short time. Genetic manipulations that turned off MafB and c Maf in the macrophages caused the cells to start a self renewal program. The similar network also controls embryonic stem cell self renewal but is associated with distinct embryonic stem cell specific enhancers. Hence macrophages isolated from MafB and c Maf double deficient mice divide indefinitely; the self renewal depends on c Myc and Klf4. Indirect lineage conversion. Indirect lineage conversion is a reprogramming methodology in which somatic cells transition through a plastic intermediate state of partially reprogrammed cells (pre iPSC), induced by brief exposure to reprogramming factors, followed by differentiation in a specially developed chemical environment (artificial niche). This method could be both more efficient and safer, since it does not seem to produce tumors or other undesirable genetic changes and results in much greater yield than other methods. However, the safety of these cells remains questionable. Since lineage conversion from pre iPSC relies on the use of iPSC reprogramming conditions, a fraction of the cells could acquire pluripotent properties if they do not stop the de differentation process in vitro or due to further de differentiation in vivo. Outer membrane glycoprotein. A common feature of pluripotent stem cells is the specific nature of protein glycosylation of their outer membrane. That distinguishes them from most nonpluripotent cells, although not from white blood cells. The glycans on the stem cell surface respond rapidly to alterations in cellular state and signaling and are therefore ideal for identifying even minor changes in cell populations. Many stem cell markers are based on cell surface glycan epitopes, including the widely used markers SSEA 3, SSEA 4, Tra 1 60 and Tra 1 81. Suila Heli et al. speculate that in human stem cells, extracellular O GlcNAc and extracellular O LacNAc play a crucial role in the fine tuning of Notch signaling pathway a highly conserved cell signaling system that regulates cell fate specification, differentiation, left right asymmetry, apoptosis, somitogenesis, and angiogenesis, and plays a key role in stem cell proliferation (reviewed by Perdigoto and Bardin and Jafar Nejad et al.) Changes in outer membrane protein glycosylation are markers of cell states connected in some way with pluripotency and differentiation. The glycosylation change is apparently not just the result of the initialization of gene expression, but also performs as an important gene regulator involved in the acquisition and maintenance of the undifferentiated state. For example, activation of glycoprotein ACA, linking glycosylphosphatidylinositol on the surface of the progenitor cells in human peripheral blood induces increased expression of genes Wnt, Notch 1, BMI1 and HOXB4 through a signaling cascade PI3K/Akt/mTor/PTEN and promotes the formation of a self renewing population of hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, dedifferentiation of progenitor cells induced by ACA dependent signaling pathway leads to ACA induced pluripotent stem cells, capable of differentiating in vitro into cells of all three germ layers. The study of lectins' ability to maintain a culture of pluripotent human stem cells has led to the discovery of lectin Erythrina crista galli (ECA), which can serve as a simple and highly effective matrix for the cultivation of human pluripotent stem cells. Reprogramming with a proteoglycan. An alternative strategy to convert somatic cells to pluripotent states may be continuous stimulation of fibroblasts by a single ECM proteoglycan, fibromodulin. Such cells exhibit capability for skeletal muscle regeneration with markedly lower tumorigenic risk when compared to iPSCs. The decreased tumorigenicity of such cells is related to CDKN2B upregulation during the recombinant human fibromodulin reprogramming process Reprogramming through a physical approach. Cell adhesion protein E cadherin is indispensable for a robust pluripotent phenotype. During reprogramming for iPS cell generation, N cadherin can replace function of E cadherin. These functions of cadherins are not directly related to adhesion because sphere morphology helps maintaining the "stemness" of stem cells. Moreover, sphere formation, due to forced growth of cells on a low attachment surface, sometimes induces reprogramming. For example, neural progenitor cells can be generated from fibroblasts directly through a physical approach without introducing exogenous reprogramming factors. Physical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells' epigenetic state. Specifically, "decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) a subunit of H3 methyltranferase by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation". Nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned fibre orientation produce effects similar to those produced by microgrooves, suggesting that changes in cell morphology may be responsible for modulation of the epigenetic state. Substrate rigidity is an important biophysical cue influencing neural induction and subtype specification. For example, soft substrates promote neuroepithelial conversion while inhibiting neural crest differentiation of hESCs in a BMP4 dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed a multi targeted mechanotransductive process involving mechanosensitive Smad phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, regulated by rigidity dependent Hippo/YAP activities and actomyosin cytoskeleton integrity and contractility. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergo self renewal in the presence of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Following LIF withdrawal, mESCs differentiate, accompanied by an increase in cell substratum adhesion and cell spreading. Restricted cell spreading in the absence of LIF by either culturing mESCs on chemically defined, weakly adhesive biosubstrates, or by manipulating the cytoskeleton, allowed the cells to remain in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state. The effect of restricted cell spreading on mESC self renewal is not mediated by increased intercellular adhesion, as inhibition of mESC adhesion using a function blocking anti E cadherin antibody or siRNA does not promote differentiation. Possible mechanisms of stem cell fate predetermination by physical interactions with the extracellular matrix have been described. A new method has been developed that turns cells into stem cells faster and more efficiently by 'squeezing' them using 3D microenvironment stiffness and density of the surrounding gel. The technique can be applied to a large number of cells to produce stem cells for medical purposes on an industrial scale. Cells involved in the reprogramming process change morphologically as the process proceeds. This results in physical differences in adhesive forces among cells. Substantial differences in 'adhesive signature' between pluripotent stem cells, partially reprogrammed cells, differentiated progeny and somatic cells allowed the development of separation process for isolation of pluripotent stem cells in microfluidic devices, which is: Stem cells possess mechanical memory (they remember past physical signals) with the Hippo signaling pathway factors: Yes associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding domain (TAZ) acting as an intracellular mechanical rheostat that stores information from past physical environments and influences the cells' fate. Neural stem cells. Stroke and many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, need cell replacement therapies. The successful use of converted neural cells (cNs) in transplantations opens a new avenue to treat such diseases. Nevertheless, induced neurons (iNs) directly converted from fibroblasts are terminally committed and exhibit very limited proliferative ability that may not provide enough autologous donor cells for transplantation. Self renewing induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) provide additional advantages over iNs for both basic research and clinical applications. For example, under specific growth conditions, mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed with a single factor, Sox2, to form iNSCs that self renew in culture and after transplantation and can survive and integrate without forming tumors in mouse brains. INSCs can be derived from adult human fibroblasts by non viral techniques, thus offering a safe method for autologous transplantation or for the development of cell based disease models. Neural chemically induced progenitor cells (ciNPCs) can be generated from mouse tail tip fibroblasts and human urinary somatic cells without introducing exogenous factors, but by a chemical cocktail, namely VCR (V, VPA, an inhibitor of HDACs; C, CHIR99021, an inhibitor of GSK 3 kinases and R, RepSox, an inhibitor of TGF beta signaling pathways), under a physiological hypoxic condition. Alternative cocktails with inhibitors of histone deacetylation, glycogen synthase kinase and TGF pathways (where: sodium butyrate (NaB) or Trichostatin A (TSA) could replace VPA, Lithium chloride (LiCl) or lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) could substitute CHIR99021, or Repsox may be replaced with SB 431542 or Tranilast) show similar efficacies for ciNPC induction. Zhang, et al., also report highly efficient reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced neural stem cell like cells (ciNSLCs) using a cocktail of nine components. Multiple methods of direct transformation of somatic cells into induced neural stem cells have been described. Proof of principle experiments demonstrate that it is possible to convert transplanted human fibroblasts and human astrocytes directly in the brain that are engineered to express inducible forms of neural reprogramming genes, into neurons, when reprogramming genes (Ascl1, Brn2a and Myt1l) are activated after transplantation using a drug. Astrocytes the most common neuroglial brain cells, which contribute to scar formation in response to injury can be directly reprogrammed in vivo to become functional neurons that form networks in mice without the need for cell transplantation. The researchers followed the mice for nearly a year to look for signs of tumor formation and reported finding none. The same researchers have turned scar forming astrocytes into progenitor cells, called neuroblasts, that regenerated into neurons in the injured adult spinal cord. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Without myelin to insulate neurons, nerve signals quickly lose power. Diseases that attack myelin, such as multiple sclerosis, result in nerve signals that cannot propagate to nerve endings and as a consequence lead to cognitive, motor and sensory problems. Transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which can successfully create myelin sheaths around nerve cells, is a promising potential therapeutic response. Direct lineage conversion of mouse and rat fibroblasts into oligodendroglial cells provides a potential source of OPCs. Conversion by forced expression of both eight or of the three transcription factors Sox10, Olig2 and Zfp536, may provide such cells. Cardiomyocytes. Cell based in vivo therapies may provide a transformative approach to augment vascular and muscle growth and to prevent non contractile scar formation by delivering transcription factors or microRNAs to the heart. Cardiac fibroblasts, which represent 50% of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte like cells in vivo by local delivery of cardiac core transcription factors ( GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5 and for improved reprogramming plus ESRRG, MESP1, Myocardin and ZFPM2) after coronary ligation. These results implicated therapies that can directly remuscularize the heart without cell transplantation. However, the efficiency of such reprogramming turned out to be very low and the phenotype of received cardiomyocyte like cells does not resemble those of a mature normal cardiomyocyte. Furthermore, transplantation of cardiac transcription factors into injured murine hearts resulted in poor cell survival and minimal expression of cardiac genes. Meanwhile, advances in the methods of obtaining cardiac myocytes in vitro occurred. Efficient cardiac differentiation of human iPS cells gave rise to progenitors that were retained within infarcted rat hearts and reduced remodeling of the heart after ischemic damage. The team of scientists, led by Sheng Ding, used a cocktail of nine chemicals (9C) for transdifferentiation of human skin cells into beating heart cells. With this method, more than 97% of the cells began beating, a characteristic of fully developed, healthy heart cells. The chemically induced cardiomyocyte like cells (ciCMs) uniformly contracted and resembled human cardiomyocytes in their transcriptome, epigenetic, and electrophysiological properties. When transplanted into infarcted mouse hearts, 9C treated fibroblasts were efficiently converted to ciCMs and developed into healthy looking heart muscle cells within the organ. This chemical reprogramming approach, after further optimization, may offer an easy way to provide the cues that induce heart muscle to regenerate locally. In another study, ischemic cardiomyopathy in the murine infarction model was targeted by iPS cell transplantation. It synchronized failing ventricles, offering a regenerative strategy to achieve resynchronization and protection from decompensation by dint of improved left ventricular conduction and contractility, reduced scarring and reversal of structural remodelling. One protocol generated populations of up to 98% cardiomyocytes from hPSCs simply by modulating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway at defined time points in during differentiation, using readily accessible small molecule compounds. Discovery of the mechanisms controlling the formation of cardiomyocytes led to the development of the drug ITD 1, which effectively clears the cell surface from TGF receptor type II and selectively inhibits intracellular TGF signaling. It thus selectively enhances the differentiation of uncommitted mesoderm to cardiomyocytes, but not to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. One project seeded decellularized mouse hearts with human iPSC derived multipotential cardiovascular progenitor cells. The introduced cells migrated, proliferated and differentiated in situ into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells to reconstruct the hearts. In addition, the heart's extracellular matrix (the substrate of heart scaffold) signalled the human cells into becoming the specialised cells needed for proper heart function. After 20 days of perfusion with growth factors, the engineered heart tissues started to beat again and were responsive to drugs. Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte like cells (iCMs) "in situ" represents a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration. Mice exposed "in vivo", to three cardiac transcription factors GMT (Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5) and the small molecules: SB 431542 (the transforming growth factor (TGF) inhibitor), and XAV939 (the WNT inhibitor) for 2 weeks after myocardial infarction showed significantly improved reprogramming (reprogramming efficiency increased eight fold) and cardiac function compared to those exposed to only GMT. See also: review Rejuvenation of the muscle stem cell. The elderly often suffer from progressive muscle weakness and regenerative failure owing in part to elevated activity of the p38 and p38 mitogen activated kinase pathway in senescent skeletal muscle stem cells. Subjecting such stem cells to transient inhibition of p38 and p38 in conjunction with culture on soft hydrogel substrates rapidly expands and rejuvenates them that result in the return of their strength. In geriatric mice, resting satellite cells lose reversible quiescence by switching to an irreversible pre senescence state, caused by derepression of p16INK4a (also called Cdkn2a). On injury, these cells fail to activate and expand, even in a youthful environment. p16INK4a silencing in geriatric satellite cells restores quiescence and muscle regenerative functions. Myogenic progenitors for potential use in disease modeling or cell based therapies targeting skeletal muscle could also be generated directly from induced pluripotent stem cells using free floating spherical culture (EZ spheres) in a culture medium supplemented with high concentrations (100 ng/ml) of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2) and epidermal growth factor. Hepatocytes. Unlike current protocols for deriving hepatocytes from human fibroblasts, Saiyong Zhu et al., (2014) did not generate iPSCs but, using small molecules, cut short reprogramming to pluripotency to generate an induced multipotent progenitor cell (iMPC) state from which endoderm progenitor cells and subsequently hepatocytes (iMPC Heps) were efficiently differentiated. After transplantation into an immune deficient mouse model of human liver failure, iMPC Heps proliferated extensively and acquired levels of hepatocyte function similar to those of human primary adult hepatocytes. iMPC Heps did not form tumours, most probably because they never entered a pluripotent state. These results establish the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, which removes a long standing roadblock on the path to autologous liver cell therapy. A cocktail of small molecules, Y 27632, A 83 01 (a TGF kinase/activin receptor like kinase (ALK5) inhibitor), and CHIR99021 (potent inhibitor of GSK 3), can convert rat and mouse mature hepatocytes in vitro into proliferative bipotent cells CLiPs (chemically induced liver progenitors). CLiPs can differentiate into both mature hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells that can form functional ductal structures. In long term culture CLiPs did not lose their proliferative capacity and their hepatic differentiation ability, and can repopulate chronically injured liver tissue. Insulin producing cells. Complications of Diabetes mellitus such as cardiovascular diseases, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and peripheral circulatory diseases depend on sugar dysregulation due to lack of insulin from pancreatic beta cells and can be lethal if they are not treated. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs). Unfortunately, human PSC derived insulin expressing cells resemble human fetal cells rather than adult cells. In contrast to adult cells, fetal cells seem functionally immature, as indicated by increased basal glucose secretion and lack of glucose stimulation and confirmed by RNA seq of whose transcripts. An alternative strategy is the conversion of fibroblasts towards distinct endodermal progenitor cell populations and, using cocktails of signalling factors, successful differentiation of these endodermal progenitor cells into functional beta like cells both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of the three transcription factors, PDX1 (required for pancreatic bud outgrowth and beta cell maturation), NGN3 (required for endocrine precursor cell formation) and MAFA (for beta cell maturation) combination (called PNM) can lead to the transformation of some cell types into a beta cell like state. An accessible and abundant source of functional insulin producing cells is intestine. PMN expression in human intestinal "organoids" stimulates the conversion of intestinal epithelial cells into like cells possibly acceptable for transplantation. Nephron Progenitors. Adult proximal tubule cells were directly transcriptionally reprogrammed to nephron progenitors of the embryonic kidney, using a pool of six genes of instructive transcription factors (SIX1, SIX2, OSR1, Eyes absent homolog 1(EYA1), Homeobox A11 (HOXA11) and Snail homolog 2 (SNAI2)) that activated genes consistent with a cap mesenchyme/nephron progenitor phenotype in the adult proximal tubule cell line. The generation of such cells may lead to cellular therapies for adult renal disease. Embryonic kidney organoids placed into adult rat kidneys can undergo onward development and vascular development. Blood vessel cells. As blood vessels age, they often become abnormal in structure and function, thereby contributing to numerous age associated diseases including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis of arteries supplying the heart, brain and lower extremities. So, an important goal is to stimulate vascular growth for the collateral circulation to prevent the exacerbation of these diseases. Induced Vascular Progenitor Cells (iVPCs) are useful for cell based therapy designed to stimulate coronary collateral growth. They were generated by partially reprogramming endothelial cells. The vascular commitment of iVPCs is related to the epigenetic memory of endothelial cells, which engenders them as cellular components of growing blood vessels. That is why, when iVPCs were implanted into myocardium, they engrafted in blood vessels and increased coronary collateral flow better than iPSCs, mesenchymal stem cells, or native endothelial cells. Ex vivo genetic modification can be an effective strategy to enhance stem cell function. For example, cellular therapy employing genetic modification with Pim 1 kinase (a downstream effector of Akt, which positively regulates neovasculogenesis) of bone marrow derived cells or human cardiac progenitor cells, isolated from failing myocardium results in durability of repair, together with the improvement of functional parameters of myocardial hemodynamic performance. Stem cells extracted from fat tissue after liposuction may be coaxed into becoming progenitor smooth muscle cells (iPVSMCs) found in arteries and veins. The 2D culture system of human iPS cells&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nbt1287"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with triple marker selection (CD34 (a surface glycophosphoprotein expressed on developmentally early embryonic fibroblasts), NP1 (receptor neuropilin 1) and KDR (kinase insert domain containing receptor)) for the isolation of vasculogenic precursor cells from human iPSC, generated endothelial cells that, after transplantation, formed stable, functional mouse blood vessels in vivo, lasting for 280 days.&lt;ref name="doi10.1073/pnas.1310675110"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To treat infarction, it is important to prevent the formation of fibrotic scar tissue. This can be achieved in vivo by transient application of paracrine factors that redirect native heart progenitor stem cell contributions from scar tissue to cardiovascular tissue. For example, in a mouse myocardial infarction model, a single intramyocardial injection of human vascular endothelial growth factor A mRNA (VEGF A modRNA), modified to escape the body's normal defense system, results in long term improvement of heart function due to mobilization and redirection of epicardial progenitor cells toward cardiovascular cell types.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nbt.2682"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Blood stem cells. Red blood cells. RBC transfusion is necessary for many patients. However, to date the supply of RBCs remains labile. In addition, transfusion risks infectious disease transmission. A large supply of safe RBCs generated in vitro would help to address this issue. Ex vivo erythroid cell generation may provide alternative transfusion products to meet present and future clinical requirements. Red blood cells (RBC)s generated in vitro from mobilized CD34 positive cells have normal survival when transfused into an autologous recipient. RBC produced in vitro contained exclusively fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which rescues the functionality of these RBCs. In vivo the switch of fetal to adult hemoglobin was observed after infusion of nucleated erythroid precursors derived from iPSCs. Although RBCs do not have nuclei and therefore can not form a tumor, their immediate erythroblasts precursors have nuclei. The terminal maturation of erythroblasts into functional RBCs requires a complex remodeling process that ends with extrusion of the nucleus and the formation of an enucleated RBC. Cell reprogramming often disrupts enucleation. Transfusion of in vitro generated RBCs or erythroblasts does not sufficiently protect against tumor formation. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway (which has been shown to be involved in the promotion of cancer cell development) plays an important role in normal blood cell development. AhR activation in human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPs) drives an unprecedented expansion of HPs, megakaryocyte and erythroid lineage cells. See also Concise Review: The SH2B3 gene encodes a negative regulator of cytokine signaling and naturally occurring loss of function variants in this gene increase RBC counts in vivo. Targeted suppression of SH2B3 in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells enhanced the maturation and overall yield of in vitro derived RBCs. Moreover, inactivation of SH2B3 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells allowed enhanced erythroid cell expansion with preserved differentiation. Platelets. Platelets help prevent hemorrhage in thrombocytopenic patients and patients with thrombocythemia. A significant problem for multitransfused patients is refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Thus, the ability to generate platelet products ex vivo and platelet products lacking HLA antigens in serum free media would have clinical value. An RNA interference based mechanism used a lentiviral vector to express short hairpin RNAi targeting 2 microglobulin transcripts in CD34 positive cells. Generated platelets demonstrated an 85% reduction in class I HLA antigens. These platelets appeared to have normal function in vitro One clinically applicable strategy for the derivation of functional platelets from human iPSC involves the establishment of stable immortalized megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines (imMKCLs) through doxycycline dependent overexpression of BMI1 and BCL XL. The resulting imMKCLs can be expanded in culture over extended periods (4 5 months), even after cryopreservation. Halting the overexpression (by the removal of doxycycline from the medium) of c MYC, BMI1 and BCL XL in growing imMKCLs led to the production of CD42b+ platelets with functionality comparable to that of native platelets on the basis of a range of assays in vitro and in vivo. Thomas et al., describe a forward programming strategy relying on the concurrent exogenous expression of 3 transcription factors: GATA1, FLI1 and TAL1. The forward programmed megakaryocytes proliferate and differentiate in culture for several months with megakaryocyte purity over 90% reaching up to 2x105 mature megakaryocytes per input hPSC. Functional platelets are generated throughout the culture allowing the prospective collection of several transfusion units from as few as one million starting hPSCs. See also overview Immune cells. A specialised type of white blood cell, known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), are produced by the immune system and are able to recognise specific markers on the surface of various infectious or tumour cells, causing them to launch an attack to kill the harmful cells. Thence, immunotherapy with functional antigen specific T cells has potential as a therapeutic strategy for combating many cancers and viral infections. However, cell sources are limited, because they are produced in small numbers naturally and have a short lifespan. A potentially efficient approach for generating antigen specific CTLs is to revert mature immune T cells into iPSCs, which possess indefinite proliferative capacity in vitro and after their multiplication to coax them to redifferentiate back into T cells. Another method combines iPSC and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&lt;ref name="doi10.1158/2159 8290.CD 12 0548"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; technologies to generate human T cells targeted to CD19, an antigen expressed by malignant B cells, in tissue culture.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nbt.2678"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This approach of generating therapeutic human T cells may be useful for cancer immunotherapy and other medical applications. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells have great clinical potential as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. iNKT cells act as innate T lymphocytes and serve as a bridge between the innate and acquired immune systems. They augment anti tumor responses by producing interferon gamma (IFN ).&lt;ref name="doi10.1155/2012/720803"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of collection, reprogramming/dedifferentiation, re differentiation and injection has been proposed for related tumor treatment. Dendritic cells (DC) are specialized to control T cell responses. DC with appropriate genetic modifications may survive long enough to stimulate antigen specific CTL and after that be completely eliminated. DC like antigen presenting cells obtained from human induced pluripotent stem cells can serve as a source for vaccination therapy. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP ) induces transdifferentiation of B cells into macrophages at high efficiencies and enhances reprogramming into iPS cells when co expressed with transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc. with a 100 fold increase in iPS cell reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the population.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nature12885"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, C/EBPa can convert selected human B cell lymphoma and leukemia cell lines into macrophage like cells at high efficiencies, impairing the cells' tumor forming capacity.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.003"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thymic epithelial cells rejuvenation. The thymus is the first organ to deteriorate as people age. This shrinking is one of the main reasons the immune system becomes less effective with age. Diminished expression of the thymic epithelial cell transcription factor FOXN1 has been implicated as a component of the mechanism regulating age related involution. Clare Blackburn and colleagues show that established age related thymic involution can be reversed by forced upregulation of just one transcription factor FOXN1 in the thymic epithelial cells in order to promote rejuvenation, proliferation and differentiation of these cells into fully functional thymic epithelium. This rejuvenation and increased proliferation was accompanied by upregulation of genes that promote cell cycle progression (cyclin D1, Np63, FgfR2IIIb) and that are required in the thymic epithelial cells to promote specific aspects of T cell development (Dll4, Kitl, Ccl25, Cxcl12, Cd40, Cd80, Ctsl, Pax1). In the future, this method may be widely used to enhance immune function and combat Inflammaging in patients by rejuvenating the thymus " in situ ". Mesenchymal stem cells. Induction. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are under investigation for applications in cardiac, renal, neural, joint and bone repair, as well as in inflammatory conditions and hemopoietic cotransplantation. This is because of their immunosuppressive properties and ability to differentiate into a wide range of mesenchymal lineage tissues. MSCs are typically harvested from adult bone marrow or fat, but these require painful invasive procedures and are low frequency sources, making up only 0.001 0.01% of bone marrow cells and 0.05% in liposuction aspirates. Of concern for autologous use, in particular in the elderly most in need of tissue repair, MSCs decline in quantity and quality with age. IPSCs could be obtained by the cells rejuvenation of even centenarians. Because iPSCs can be harvested free of ethical constraints and culture can be expanded indefinitely, they are an advantageous source of MSCs. IPSC treatment with SB 431542 leads to rapid and uniform MSC generation from human iPSCs. (SB 431542 is an inhibitor of activin/TGF pathways by blocking phosphorylation of ALK4, ALK5 and ALK7 receptors.) These iPS MSCs may lack teratoma forming ability, display a normal stable karyotype in culture and exhibit growth and differentiation characteristics that closely resemble those of primary MSCs. It has potential for in vitro scale up, enabling MSC based therapies. MSC derived from iPSC have the capacity to aid periodontal regeneration and are a promising source of readily accessible stem cells for use in the clinical treatment of periodontitis. Lai et al., &amp; Lu report the chemical method to generate MSC like cells (iMSCs), from human primary dermal fibroblasts using six chemical inhibitors (SP600125, SB202190, Go6983, Y 27632, PD0325901, and CHIR99021) with or without 3 growth factors (transforming growth factor (TGF ), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)). The chemical cocktail directly converts human fibroblasts to iMSCs with a monolayer culture in 6 days, and the conversion rate was approximately 38%. Besides cell therapy in vivo, the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells can be used in vitro for mass production of exosomes, which are ideal vehicles for drug delivery. Dedifferentiated adipocytes. Adipose tissue, because of its abundance and relatively less invasive harvest methods, represents a source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Unfortunately, liposuction aspirates are only 0.05% MSCs. However, a large amount of mature adipocytes, which in general have lost their proliferative abilities and therefore are typically discarded, can be easily isolated from the adipose cell suspension and dedifferentiated into lipid free fibroblast like cells, named dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. DFAT cells re establish active proliferation ability and express multipotent capacities. Compared with adult stem cells, DFAT cells show unique advantages in abundance, isolation and homogeneity. Under proper induction culture in vitro or proper environment in vivo, DFAT cells could demonstrate adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic and myogenic potentials. They could also exhibit perivascular characteristics and elicit neovascularization. Chondrogenic cells. Cartilage is the connective tissue responsible for frictionless joint movement. Its degeneration ultimately results in complete loss of joint function in the late stages of osteoarthritis. As an avascular and hypocellular tissue, cartilage has a limited capacity for self repair. Chondrocytes are the only cell type in cartilage, in which they are surrounded by the extracellular matrix that they secrete and assemble. One method of producing cartilage is to induce it from iPS cells. Alternatively, it is possible to convert fibroblasts directly into induced chondrogenic cells (iChon) without an intermediate iPS cell stage, by inserting three reprogramming factors (c MYC, KLF4 and SOX9). Human iChon cells expressed marker genes for chondrocytes (type II collagen) but not fibroblasts. Implanted into defects created in the articular cartilage of rats, human iChon cells survived to form cartilaginous tissue for at least four weeks, with no tumors. The method makes use of c MYC, which is thought to have a major role in tumorigenesis and employs a retrovirus to introduce the reprogramming factors, excluding it from unmodified use in human therapy. Sources of cells for reprogramming. The most frequently used sources for reprogramming are blood cells and fibroblasts, obtained by biopsy of the skin, but taking cells from urine is less invasive. The latter method does not require a biopsy or blood sampling. As of 2013, urine derived stem cells had been differentiated into endothelial, osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, skeletal myogenic and neurogenic lineages, without forming teratomas. Therefore, their epigenetic memory is suited to reprogramming into iPS cells. However, few cells appear in urine, only low conversion efficiencies had been achieved and the risk of bacterial contamination is relatively high. Another promising source of cells for reprogramming are mesenchymal stem cells derived from human hair follicles. The origin of somatic cells used for reprogramming may influence the efficiency of reprogramming, the functional properties of the resulting induced stem cells and the ability to form tumors. IPSCs retain an epigenetic memory of their tissue of origin, which impacts their differentiation potential. This epigenetic memory does not necessarily manifest itself at the pluripotency stage iPSCs derived from different tissues exhibit proper morphology, express pluripotency markers and are able to differentiate into the three embryonic layers in vitro and in vivo. However, this epigenetic memory may manifest during re differentiation into specific cell types that require the specific loci bearing residual epigenetic marks.
Providence is an unincorporated community in Anderson County, in the U.S. state of Texas. It is a part of the Palestine, Texas micropolitan area. History. Providence got its start by a land grant given to W.T. Miller on March 20, 1858, in which he was given 8 acres of land for a church and a cemetery. The residents and the community's masons built a two story tall building with a church in the downstairs area, and a lodge called Providence Lodge No. 400 in the upstairs area. This lodge was chartered on June 15, 1874, and a man named George H. Stovall was the master. A tornado came by in 1900 and completely destroyed the building, which was then moved to the nearby town of Elkhart five years later. The community's church members worshipped under an arbor until the materials that were not destroyed by the 1900 tornado were used to build a new, one story building. The community had numerous houses in the 1930s. The community's church then voted for its closure in 1935. Then, on June 3, 1973, that church and its cemetery were given a dedication by a Texas Historical Marker. Every first Sunday of June each year is when a memorial service for the church occurs. This church and its cemetery and a few scattered houses were the only things remaining in the community in 1992. Eight years later, in 2000, Providence was featured on county highway maps, but never had a population estimate available. Geography. Providence stands just off of Farm to Market Road 323 near Slocum, approximately northwest of Palestine in the northwestern portion of Anderson County. Education. A school was to be built in Providence on the eight acre land grant given to W.T. Miller on March 20, 1858, and the community's lodge was also used as a school. The community's school served 48 Black students in 1897, and was eventually closed in 1905. Afterwards, the community's school age children attended school in nearby communities. Another school opened in the community in the 1930s.
The 1952 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania was held on November 4, 1952. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Edward Martin successfully sought re election to another term, defeating the Democratic nominee, Guy K. Bard.
John Burgherlin (Burgherlinus, Burgherssh, Bourgherssh, or Burwais) was a pre Reformation cleric who was the Bishop of Sodor and Man in the first half of the 15th century. He appears to have been appointed twice. In the first appointment, dated 30 July 1425, he was called John Burgherlin () and was a Franciscan friar, but it is uncertain whether he got possession of the see. It may be that Richard Payl was still recognised bishop on the Isle of Man until circa 1429 33. In the second appointment, dated 22 April 1433, he was called John Burwais () and was a Cluniac monk. He was granted permission by Pope Eugene IV on 18 October 1433 to be consecrated by any Catholic bishop without prejudice as a suffragan to the Archbishop of York. Because of the different names and religious orders, it is debatable whether it was the same person appointed in 1425 and again 1433, or there were two different people. According to Dowden's "The Bishops of Scotland", it was same person. With Eubel's "Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi", it is not so clear. In each volume of the "Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi", the last appointee in one volume is shown as the first in the next volume.

Bob Weber, Sr. (June 26, 1934 October 17, 2020), was an American cartoonist, best known for his "Moose and Molly" comic strip, distributed by King Features Syndicate. Early life. Weber was born and raised in South Baltimore. He attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1953. Career. Weber's career as a cartoonist and illustrator moved into high gear in 1959, when he contributed to "The Saturday Evening Post" and the syndicated "Laff a Day" panels. Relocating to Connecticut, he became cartoonist Dick Cavalli's assistant on "Winthrop". In 1965, he launched his own strip, which began September 20, 1965, as "Moose", retitled "Moose Miller" six years later. It was renamed "Moose and Molly" (aka "Moose &amp; Molly") in 1998. After peaking with 200 newspapers, it eventually dropped to 75 papers. Weber lived in Westport, Connecticut, which he referred to as "Westpork". Weber's son, cartoonist Bob Weber, Jr., reaches a readership of 30 million with his "Slylock Fox &amp; Comics for Kids" puzzle feature. He also co created the short lived "Oh, Brother!" strip.

Function. The WWE domains occur in two functional classes of proteins, namely those associated with ubiquitination and those associated with poly ADP ribosylation (PARP). Hence, WWE domains hold an important function in signal transduction, protein degradation, DNA repair and apoptosis. Protein Interactions. The WWE domain is named after three of its conserved residues, W and E residues (tryptophans and glutamate respectively), and is predicted to mediate specific protein protein interactions in ubiquitin and ADP ribose conjugation systems (Poly ADP ribose polymerase). This domain is found as a tandem repeat at the N terminal of Deltex, a cytosolic effector of Notch signalling thought to bind the N terminal of the Notch receptor. It is also found as an interaction module in protein ubiquination and ADP ribosylation proteins. Structure. Within each WWE module, the residues form two similar structures vital to its stability. The two WWE modules interact and form a large cleft suitable for binding of extended polypeptides. The two WWE modules adopt compact structures mostly composed of beta strands, with a single three turn alpha helix in both modules and an additional short helical segment in the second WWE module. The two WWE modules hold a two fold rotation axis.
Josef Ochs (March 31, 1905 in Schmitten November 12, 1987) was a German Police officer and SS "Obersturmf hrer". He was involved in the deportation of Sinti and Roma people. He was present in the Berlin "F hrerbunker" during the last days of Hitler. Ochs left the bunker complex on May 1, 1945. During the postwar period he worked in the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) as head of the support group from 1951 to 1965. He was also the head of news gathering. Early life. Josef Ochs was born in Schmitten on March 31, 1905. His parents (father named Taunus Schmitten) worked in lumber and wool farming. After completing High school in 1925 he studied Law and economics at the University of Frankfurt, University of Munich and University of Erlangen Nuremberg. In 1933 he earned his Ph.D and began working in his father's factory until September 1936 in which he became a partner in a shoe trading company. Police career and the Nazi Party. In early October 1936 he began working in the police force, and passed his Commissioner exams in Frankfurt during July 1938 with "good" grades. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 with membership number, 5927971. In February 1938, Ochs joined the "Schutzstaffel" (SS) with membership number, 290982. On July 2, 1938, he was promoted to SS "Obersturmf hrer". In September 1938, Ochs married the daughter of a pharmacist who was 13 years his junior. The couple had two children during the period of 1939 and 1943. At the end of 1938 he was transferred to D sseldorf. On January 15, 1939, he was appointed a detective with the Nazi "Kriminalpolizei" or Kripo. Later, from late 1939 to July 1941 he worked as an officer responsible for admissions to the Nazi concentration camps; including the Maideportation camp in Cologne. He was involved in the deportation of Sinti and Roma people. He was present in the Berlin "F hrerbunker" during the last days of Hitler in April, 1945. Ochs left the bunker complex on May 1, 1945. Post war. After the surrender of Germany in May 1945, Ochs was sent to the detention center at Neuengamme, until the beginning of June 1945. During the postwar period he worked in the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) as head of the support group from 1951 to 1965. He was also the head of news gathering.
The Apse of Sant Climent de Ta ll () is a Romanesque fresco in the National Art Museum of Catalonia, Barcelona. This is one of the masterpieces of the European Romanesque. from which the unknown Master of Ta ll takes his name. Painted in the early 12th century, it was in the church of Sant Climent de Ta ll at the Vall de Bo , Alta Ribagor a in the Catalan Pyrenees until removed in 1919 1923, along with other parts of the fresco decoration, in an attempt to preserve the paintings by placing them in a stable, secure museum setting. The apse has been replaced in the church by a replica, and some original decoration remains there. MNAC Barcelona also has the paintings from the triumphal arches, a side apse, the consecration inscription and an earlier window. Description. Its genius lies in the way it combines elements from different Biblical visions ("Revelation", "Isaiah and Ezekiel") to present the "Christ of the Day of Judgement". Christ appears from the background causing a movement outwards from the centre of the composition, which is presided by the ornamental sense of the outlines and the skilful use of colour to create volume. The exceptional nature of this work and its pictorial strength have reached out to modernity and fascinated twentieth century avant garde artists like Picasso and Francis Picabia. The round surface beneath Christ's feet represents the earth and the halo on his head represents divinity. Christ's right hand symbolizes blessing, and in his left hand he holds a book with the words EGO SUM LUX MUNDI, which translates in English to I am the light of the world . The symbols of Alpha and Omega hanging like lamps on either side of Christ, symbolize the beginning and end. The fourfold images represent four evangelists. To the right, an angel is seen beside the lion holding one of its hind legs, which is a symbol of St. Mark. To the left, an angel holding the tail of the bull is a symbol of St. Luke. The other two evangelists fit into the triangular space on either side of the mandorla. An angel holding the Gospel Book represents St. Matthew, and the other angel is St. John holding an eagle in his arms. Below the mural painting of Christ in the mandorla is St Thomas, St Bartholomew, Mother of God, St. John the Evangelist, St. James and San Felipe. The Mother of God holds a bowl where red rays emerge from it, which symbolize the blood of Christ. History. The paintings in the central apse of Sant Climent in Ta ll are the most emblematic in the Museum's collection of Romanesque art and make up one of the most representative and one of the finest works of Romanesque art. The central theme of the apse is a Theophany, or vision of God, at the end of time, based mainly on the text of Revelation. In the middle, Christ in Majesty inscribed in a mandorla, seated on the arc of Heaven and with the Earth at his feet, blesses with his right hand, while his left holds a book with the inscription EGO SUM LUX MUNDI ( I am the light of the world'). On either side are the Alpha and the Omega, symbols that God is the beginning and the end of all things. He is surrounded by the four Evangelists. Saints, apostles and the Virgin Mary occupy the semi cylinder and several scenes from the Old and New Testaments are depicted on the arches over the entrance to the apse. One scene that stands out is of Lazarus the beggar at the door of the rich man Epulon's house, on the intrados of the arch, and at the top, the hand of God and the Agnus Dei (the Lamb of God), symbolising the death and resurrection of Christ (Rev 5, 6 14). The style combines the geometricisation of forms and the general symmetry of the composition with the decorativism in the details and ornamental elements. The volume of the pronounced drapery is geometrical, emphasised by coloured lines and glazing, contrasting with the flat tones of the background. In addition, the symmetry, frontality, hieratic nature and the very representation of God could derive from Byzantine art, possibly via Italy. The bands of colour in the backgrounds, present in many Catalan Romanesque paintings, could remind us of what is known as Mozarabic illumination in tenth century Hispanic manuscripts. The exceptional artistic nature and the high quality of these paintings have been corroborated by the study of the pigments, which are of better quality and preparation than in other Catalan churches. Some imported pigments have even been found. Through the use of superimposed layers, the painter obtains more intense chromatic effects. Thus blue, obtained from aerinite, is applied over a layer of black, and cinnabar is applied over haematite to get red. Painted on one of the columns of the nave is the church's inscription of consecration by bishop Ramon de Roda from Ribagorza on 10 December 1123. This reference is fundamental for dating the paintings, of which there are still remains in situ.

U Camelopardalis is a semiregular variable star in the constellation Camelopardalis. Based on parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft, it is located about 3,000 light years (1,000 parsecs) away from the Earth. Its apparent visual magnitude is about 8, which is dim enough that it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. The spectral type of U Camelopardalis in the revised MK system is C N5, which indicates a classical carbon star spectrum approximately corresponding to late K or early M. The C2 index is 5.5 which is typical of a C N star. It is also given an alternative spectral type of MS4, indicating a star similar to an M4 class but with somewhat enhanced ZrO bands. The spectral type may vary between C3,9 and C6,4e. U Camelopardalis is a carbon star. These types of stars have greater levels of carbon in their atmospheres than oxygen, which means they form carbon compounds that make the star appear strikingly red. U Camelopardalis is nearly 4 magnitudes fainter at blue wavelengths than in the centre of the visual range. In the infra red K band it has an apparent magnitude of 0.37. Its brightness varies without a dominant period and it is classified as semi regular, although a period of 400 days has been published. In the V photometric band the brightness varies by around half a magnitude, but the amplitude is nearly two magnitudes at blue wavelengths. The maximum visual magnitude has been given as 7.2. The shell of gas surrounding U Camelopardalis was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2012, showing a nearly perfect sphere of gas surrounding the star. U Cameloparadlis has a 10th magnitude companion 308" away. It is a B8 main sequence star, hotter but less luminous than U Cam itself. They are not thought to be physically associated.
Frances was a cutter built in 1839 at Encounter Bay, South Australia. It was wrecked on South Neptune Island on 29 August 1840. It was reported that the crew survived the wrecking event, came ashore and survived on a diet of penguin for 50 days before sending 2 people in a dinghy to Port Lincoln to seek help. Those remaining at South Neptune Island were subsequently rescued. While the wreck site is protected by the Commonwealth "Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976" and its location is recorded as being at , as of 2004 it had not been found.
Moriconi is a surname. Notable people with the surname include:
Pinguicula balcanica, also known as the Balkanian butterwort, is a perennial carnivorous plant in the family Lentibulariaceae. Distribution. The plant is endemic to the Balkans. It is found in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Serbia. It grows in the subalpine parts of mountains at an altitude of above sea level. It, like most carnivorous plants, grows in wet, nutrient poor, acidic environments and can often be found in high altitude sphagnum bogs, near streams, and wet rocky places in mountains. Description. It flowers in spring, from May to August, and produces seed from July to September. It survives winter in a hibernaculum.
The Main Sieg Express is a Regional Express service operated by the German states of North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) and Hesse from Siegen via Gie en to Frankfurt. It is operated by the Hessische Landesbahn (Hessian State Railway, HLB). History. On 25 June 2008, the Rhein Main Verkehrsverbund (Rhine Main Transport Association, RMV) and the "Zweckverband Nahverkehr Westfalen Lippe" (Local transport association of Westphalia Lippe, NWL) announced in a joint press statement that Hessische Landesbahn has won a Europe wide tender and would take over the operation of the service for 13 years with effect on 12 December 2010. Until the commencement of the 2010/2011 timetable in December 2010, DB Regio Hesse had been operator of this service, which, after the elimination of long distance services between Siegen Weidenau and Frankfurt in 2001, had originally been established as an Interregio Express. In the early years, however, the Regional Express service was characterised by a much longer journey time than the Interregio service due to capacity problems on the Main Weser Railway. Travel times with a change in Gie en were up to 20 minutes faster than direct Main Sieg Express services. A change in the timings of Intercity service IC 26 between Frankfurt and Giessen in December 2009 allowed the Main Sieg Express to run with shorter travel times, almost as fast as the InterRegio timings. Before the change of operators in 2010, the service was operated by DB Regio NRW every two hours via Giessen to Cologne. Route. The Regional Express operates from Siegen to Giessen as RE 99 on the Dill line stopping in Haiger, Dillenburg, Herborn and Wetzlar. In Giessen, from Monday to Friday, it is coupled together with a set from Marburg, which is designated as RE 98, and reverses to run on the Main Weser Railway to Frankfurt with a stop at Friedberg. Rolling stock. The service is operated with Stadler FLIRT electric multiple units. Five carriage sets are operated between Siegen and Frankfurt, while the Marburg Giessen set is operated with three carriage sets. Before December 2010, the Siegen Frankfurt line had been operated for many years with class 111 locomotives hauling five or six double deck carriages, or alternatively, with class 110 locomotives hauling six Silberling carriages. Operations. Services run every day at least once every two hours over the whole route. Train runs hourly on the Siegen Gie en section, but there are periods on weekends when services do not run every hour. A section of the train is detached/attached to run between Marburg and Giessen only between Monday and Friday. Since the change to the 2011/2012 timetable on 11 December 2011, the Marburg section of the train stops regularly in Friedelhausen and Niederweimar except for the late night through train from Marburg to Siegen. In addition, a fast connection is provided for commuters in the peaks on the Dill line to Frankfurt. A service called "RE Sprinter" is operated from Monday to Friday during the peaks in each direction, which runs on the Dutenhofen Gie en Bergwald route, which is otherwise used only by freight trains. This eliminates the time consuming change of direction in Gie en. A significant reduction in travel time is currently achieved only on the evening train to Siegen. The morning train to Frankfurt uses the time saved to make additional intermediate stops in Frankfurt. The RE Sprinters are the only passenger trains on the Main Weser Railway that are not scheduled to stop in Friedberg.

Karl Mantzius (20 February 1860 17 May 1921) was a Danish actor, stage and film director, theatre scholar, and operatic baritone. Life and career. Mantzius was born in Copenhagen, the son of the actor Kristian Mantzius. At first he played small roles in amateur comedy plays at the Court Theatre in Copenhagen, including 'Vielgeschrey' in "Den Stundesl se" by Ludvig Holberg, which brought him so much success that the theatre manager Edvard Fallesen advised him to become an actor. He made his debut at the Royal Danish Theatre on 1 September 1883 as Jerome in "Erasmus Montanus" and became a regular presence at the theatre as both an actor and director. His later roles included Dr. Stern in "En mand gik ned fra Jerusalem", Lieutenant von Buddinge in Jens Christian Hostrup's "Gjenboerne" and Falstaff in "Henry IV." Although primarily a stage actor, he also appeared in two operas at the Royal Danish Theatre as Beckmesser in Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von N rnberg" and as Jeronimus in the 1906 world premiere of Carl Nielsen's "Maskarade". His last performance at the Royal Theatre was as Uncle Peter in "Det gamle Hjem" on 28 April 1921, less than a month before his death in Frederiksberg at the age of 61. Like his father, he was buried at the Frederiksberg ldre Kirkeg rd. In 1904, Mantzius founded the Danish Actors' Association. Filmography. Mantzius became a director at Nordisk Film in 1914 and directed three films for the company: He also appeared as an actor in the 1919 Swedish film "Hans n ds testamente" ("His Lordship's Last Will") in the role of His Lordship.
Richard Payl (Pawlie, Payli, Paylus or Pulley) was a 15th century Dominican friar. He served firstly as the Bishop of Dromore before becoming the Bishop of Mann and The Isles. He was appointed the bishop of the Diocese of Dromore by Pope Gregory XII on 30 December 1407 and was consecrated sometime before 11 November 1408. According to some publications, he was recorded as Richard Messing and which said he died in 1409. It may be there is some confusion with Richard Misyn, O.Carm., probably a later bishop of Dromore. Payl was translated to the bishoprics of Mann and The Isles by Antipope John XXIII on 30 May 1410. He was recognised as bishop of the Isles until c. 1421 and was still recognised bishop on the Isle of Man until c. 1429 1433. Bibliography.
In molecular biology, the protein domain, WIF N terminal refers to the N terminal domain of the protein, WIF. It stands for, Wnt inhibitory factor, whereby wnt is a signalling molecule also known as wingless. Wnt is a molecule in the wnt signaling pathway. The WIF domain binds to the wnt ligand since it inhibits it. Function. The function of the WIF domain is to bind to Wnt ligands and prevent the downstream signal transduction. Inevitably, this prevents cell development in embryogenesis and cancer. Structure. The domain is extracellular, meaning it is on the outside of the cell and it contains two conserved cysteines that form a disulphide bridge. This domain is Wnt binding in WIF, and it has been suggested that RYK may also bind to Wnt. More specifically, crystal structure of WIF 1(WD) show a binding site for phospholipid; two acyl chains extending deep into the domain, and a head group is exposed to the surface. Wnt Ligand. Wnt proteins constitute a large family of secreted molecules that are involved in intercellular signalling during development. The name derives from the first 2 members of the family to be discovered: int 1 (mouse) and wingless (Drosophila). It is now recognised that Wnt signalling controls many cell fate decisions in a variety of different organisms, including mammals. Wnt signalling has been implicated in tumourigenesis, early mesodermal patterning of the embryo, morphogenesis of the brain and kidneys, regulation of mammary gland proliferation and Alzheimer's disease. Wnt mediated signalling is believed to proceed initially through binding to cell surface receptors of the frizzled family; the signal is subsequently transduced through several cytoplasmic components to B catenin, which enters the nucleus and activates the transcription of several genes important in development. More recently, however, several non canonical Wnt signalling pathways have been elucidated that act independently of B catenin. Members of the Wnt gene family are defined by their sequence similarity to mouse Wnt 1 and Wingless in Drosophila. They encode proteins of ~350 400 residues in length, with orthologues identified in several, mostly vertebrate, species. Very little is known about the structure of Wnts as they are notoriously insoluble; but they share the following features characteristics of secretory proteins: a signal peptide, several potential N glycosylation sites and 22 conserved cysteines that are probably involved in disulphide bonds. The Wnt proteins seem to adhere to the plasma membrane of the secreting cells and are therefore likely to signal over only few cell diameters. Fifteen major Wnt gene families have been identified in vertebrates, with multiple subtypes within some classes.
The Joker is a comic book series published by DC Comics starring the supervillain the Joker. It ran for nine issues from May June 1975 to September October 1976, with a tenth previously unpublished issue released in October 2019. In 2021, it was relaunched as part of DC's "Infinite Frontier" relaunch following "" conclusion. Publication history. Dennis O'Neil, who wrote the first issue of the series, recounted that "I stopped by Julie [Schwartz, "Batman" editor]'s office, and he said, 'We're going to do a Joker book'. I know that alarms went off, I could sense the problems that such a thing would entail...but it was a job". The series was launched in May 1975 by O'Neil and artist Irv Novick. In order to have him work as a protagonist, writers on the series toned down the Joker's insanity and to adhere to the Comics Code Authority, each issue would end with the Joker being apprehended, only to have escaped at the beginning of the next issue (the exceptions were issue #4, where the Joker seemingly falls to his death in a whirlpool in the ocean, only to return in the next issue as if nothing had happened and with no explanation as to how he survived; issue #5, which ends with the Joker being chased by police; issue #8, where the Joker returns to Arkham Asylum voluntarily; and issue #10, which ended on a cliffhanger that was never continued). Batman did not appear in the series and the Joker was forbidden to murder anyone in the pages of his own magazine. 2020s. Following "Joker War" and "", James Tynion IV teamed up with Gulliem March to produce a new "The Joker" series that debuted on March 2, 2021. Unpublished issue #10. The letters page of "The Joker" #9 (Sept. Oct. 1976) mentions that Martin Pasko was writing a Joker vs. the Justice League of America story titled "99 and 99/100% Dead!" to appear in "The Joker" #10 as the first part of a two or three issue story arc, which was never published despite being listed as "on sale right now" on the "Daily Planet" promotional page for August 16, 1976. In the end notes of "The Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told" (1989), it is noted that "The Joker" editor Julius Schwartz had no recollection of this story ever being completed; however, Pasko found xeroxed pages of the story which he sold on eBay in 2011. A cover for issue #10 was drawn by Ernie Chan, but it was not finished at the time. "The Joker" #10 was published for the first time on August 14, 2019 in DC's "The Joker: The Bronze Age Omnibus" (which also contains "The Joker" #1 9 as well as other DC Comics Joker stories from the 1970s) and as a stand alone issue on October 3.
Dom Joseph Vaiss te (or Vaissette) (1685 1756) was a scholarly French Benedictine monk who wrote a history of Languedoc and a geography of the world as it was known in his day. Vaissette's "Histoire g n rale de Languedoc" is still considered a work of great erudition and value by modern historians. The "Geography" had its faults from lack of technology, but was the most detailed and accurate of its day. Some names for the volume differ from modern usage. Because of this, he gives the name "La C te des Dents" ("Coast of Teeth") to what is now the "C te d'Ivoire" ("Ivory Coast"). Life. Vaiss te was born at Gaillac in the diocese of Albi in April 1685. His father was the procurer general of Albi. After attending school in his hometown, Vaiss te moved to Toulouse for further his studies. He became a doctor of theology and a doctor of civil and canon law. Vaiss te wanted to enter orders immediately, but at his father's request, acted as his father's substitute as "procureur general" for several years. In 1711, Vaiss te retired from the world and took up the monastic and scholarly life. At the age of 26, on July 11, 1711, he entered the Benedictine order in the Monastery of La Daurade, in Toulouse. Shortly after, he received the news of his father's death. In 1713, Vaiss te's superiors called him to the Abbey of Saint Germain des Pr s in Paris because of his taste for history. In 1715, he was charged with co authoring a history of Languedoc with Dom Claude de Vic. [The two authors were able to use the prior work of Dom Gabriel Marcland and Dom Pierre Auzieres, two learned and capable scholars who had separately worked in the province for several years, combing the libraries for material and making considerable progress in organizing the material had not been able to continue due to their advanced age or other jobs.] The first volume of the "Histoire g n rale de Languedoc" appeared in folio in 1730. Dom de Vic died in 1734, leaving Dom Vaissette in sole charge of the great work, which he successfully executed. The work was published in four more volumes, the fifth appearing in 1745. Dom Vaissette published a four volume universal geography in 1855. The character of Dom Vaiss te combined simplicity and candour with spirit and erudition. He died at Saint Germain des Pr s on April 10, 1756. His co worker Dom Bourotte was charged with finishing Vaiss te's work on the history. Dom Vaissette was buried in the Sainte Vierge chapel with his fellow monk Dom Sensaric, who died on the same day. Work. Dom Vaissette published a dissertation on French origins in 1722, examining whether the French descended from the Tectosages, a sept of the Volcae, or from the ancient Gauls of Germany. Although the work was published in Paris anonymously, historians do not doubt that Vaissette was the author. The first volume of the "Histoire g n rale de Languedoc", which appeared in 1730, starts with the 2nd century of the Roman Republic. The volume covers the various expeditions of the Tectosages, French revolutions of the province still submitted to the Romans and the arrival of the Visigoths, Charlemagne's creation of the Kingdom of Aquitaine with its capital in Toulouse. The volume also follows leading events up to Charles the Bald's death. In this and subsequent volumes, Dom Vaissette added learned notes on aspects of the history of Languedoc at the end of the book, taking the form of scholarly dissertations on specific subjects. His notes are followed by transcriptions of ancient inscriptions, charters and other records that support the history given in the volume. Vaiss te's first volume also included a general index of names and subjects. The second volume, published in 1733, continues the history for the next three centuries from the start of Louis the Stammerer's reign in 877 up to the beginning of the troubles caused by the Albigensian heresy in 1165. It includes a history and genealogy of the Counts of Toulouse and other leading families, and the wars between these families. This volume records the participation of Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse in the First Crusade, of which he was one of the leaders, along with other noble families of the country. It also follows the establishment of several towns, many celebrated monasteries and the seats of the bishops. The third volume appeared in 1736 and the fourth in 1742, ending with the Parliament of Languedoc's last opening in 1443, which had functioned continuously since that time. The fifth volume appeared in 1745, covering the next two centuries up to the death of Louis XIII in 1643, including the religious wars that lasted for almost a century. Dom Vaissette included additions, corrections and clarifications to the four previous volumes after the notes at the end of this volume. Dom Vaissette had planned a sixth volume, which was advertised in the fifth. The abbot of Fontaines said that few general histories had been better written in the French language, and the erudition was profound and agreeable. The history was distinguished by the great impartiality with which it treated the Albigensians and other heretics who ravaged the province. Without passion or prejudice, the history presents the results of a study of all available information. The Jesuits, who had not shown the same moderation in their "Histoire de l' glise Gallicane" ("History of the Gallican Church"), criticized the work in their "Journal de Tr voux". Vaissette's erudite history continues to be respected and consulted by scholars to this day. Dom Vaissette wrote an abridged version of his "History of Languedoc" in six volumes, the first of which appeared in 1740. The abridgment may be enough for those who are not from the province, but the people of Languedoc would find it too dry and too slim. Vaissette also wrote a "Universal Geography" in four volumes. While this has faults, "Universal Geography" was viewed with reason at the time as the most detailed, methodical and accurate available. One could only reproach the author with a lack of detail on the commerce and the arts of the countries he describes. References.

As well as a complete Spinning Jenny one of only five examples left in the world the museum's displays will include a fulling machine which was patented by Trowbridge engineer, John Dyer, in 1833. It was such a technically accomplished design that the machine remained unchanged and was still in use in the 20th century. A fine teazle gig, which was used to raise the nap of the cloth, will also be on display. The machine contains numerous "handles" of teazles (this was the name for the frames into which the teazles were fixed) which were dried out in the Handle House which can be found near the town bridge and Blind House and is almost as rare as the Spinning Jenny.

Gonz lez moved to Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century and focussed on painting and metalwork. It was not until the end of the 1920s that he opted definitively for sculpture and became a notable figure in the European avant gardes. Based on his formal experiments using iron, he created a sculptural language of his own. According to the National Art Museum of Catalonia, "Still Life II" illustrates his masterly ability to combine matter and void and to extract unsuspected expressive possibilities from a simple sheet of iron.
Galerie Gmurzynska is a commercial art gallery based in Zurich, Switzerland, specializing in modern and contemporary art and work by the Russian avant garde.

The following year, the gallery presented the work of David Burliuk. Until 1971, the gallery's program focused on the Russian avant garde. Gallery founder Antonina Gmurzynska developed contacts with the artists' families, and allegedly helped to smuggle artwork that was banned by the Soviet regime out of Russia. In 1986, Antonina's daughter Krystina took over the business upon her mother's death, together with her business partner (sometimes called the "co owner") Mathias Rastorfer.

The installation was designed to be viewed through the gallery's window on Paradeplatz. Works displayed at the exhibition included Kazimir Malevich's "Red Square: Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimension", as well as paintings by Ilya Chashnik and Alexander Rodchenko. The exhibit placed the influence of the Russian artists with Hadid's work. It was the first exhibition to connect Hadid with Suprematism art, according to "Wallpaper*". At the 2014 Art Basel in Miami Beach, to celebrate their 50th anniversary, the gallery's booth was designed by film director Baz Luhrmann, costume designer Catherine Martin and music producer Nellee Hooper. The exhibition was titled "A Kid Could Do That!" It featured works by twentieth century artists such as Joan Mir , Kazimir Malevich, Wilfredo Lam, Cy Twombly and Fancis Bacon.

Controversies. 1993 smuggling of Nikolai Khardzhiev collection. The Galerie was involved in moving a major collection of documents, drawings and paintings by Russian Futurist artists estimated at around 100 million, belonging to Nikolai Khardzhiev and his wife Lidia Chaga, from Moscow to Amsterdam. In 1993, Krystyna Gmurzynska and Mathias Rastorfer visited the Khardzhievs in Moscow, and signed agreements described by Rastorfer as letters of intent over $2.5 million in exchange for six works of Malevich art worth $30 million. The gallery arranged the packing and removal of the artworks, but then left the Khadzhievs in Amsterdam and cut off communications with them while retaining control of their collections. As reported in articles published in "The New York Times" and the "New Left Review", the Khardzhievs were duped. Edelman v Gmurzynska insurance dispute. Between 2007 and 2009, Gmurzynska and Rsatorfer were involved in a further dispute. Dealer Asher B. Edelman loaned a work to Gmurzynska that was returned damaged. Gmurzynska and Rastorfer ignored the claim. In 2009, a U.S. district court judge awarded Edelman a default judgment of $765,000 to which Gmurzynska and Rastorfer failed to respond, leading four of the Gmurzynska's paintings to be seized at the Miami Beach Art Fair and held for two days until the gallery paid the judgment. Edelman was awarded an additional $250,000 for what the judge described as the gallery's "wilful conduct" in the matter, i.e. their failure to respond to the lawsuit. Gmurzynska and Rastorfer disputed any wrongdoing, stating that "The gallery never received any notice that Mr. Edelman had applied for a default judgment". 2013 Hotel Dolder VAT evasion and gallery raid by Swiss Customs. In 2013, the gallery was raided by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration regarding VAT on imported artworks worth 85M Swiss Francs supplied by the Gmurzynska gallery to the Dolder Grand Hotel, owned by Urs Schwarzenbach. Documents and computers were seized as evidence while the Hotel Dolder was subject to a simultaneous raid. Gmurzynska filed a complaint in order to prevent their inspection, but the Federal Court has ruled that in a criminal investigation of this kind where there is reasonable suspicion, the prosecuting FCA can demand to see papers it considers relevant to the case. The evidence made available to journalists indicates that a sham company issuing fake bills was used to import the works via a bonded warehouse, enabling Schwarzenbach to avoid paying the required import duty. The case was reported in Zurich's leading newspaper, the "Neue Z rcher Zeitung." 2018 hiring of Benjamin Genocchio. In 2018, Gmurzynska Gallery drew attention when Benjamin Genocchio became a partner, serving as vice president at the Gallery's New York branch. Genocchio was previously replaced as director of the Armory Show after multiple complaints of sexual harassment. Artists. Exhibited artists have included:

Partou Zia (9 October 1958 19 March 2008) was a British Iranian artist and writer. Born in Tehran, she emigrated to England in 1970, where she completed her secondary education at Whitefields school near Hendon, London (1972 78). Zia studied Art History at the University of Warwick (1977 80) and at the Slade School of Fine Art (1986 91). In 2001, she completed a PhD at Falmouth College of Arts and the University of Plymouth. In 1993, she moved to Cornwall where she lived and worked with her husband, the painter Richard Cook, until her death from cancer, in March 2008. Tate St Ives honoured her parting by hanging one of her last completed canvases, Forty Nights and Forty Days as a memorial to her, for a month, at the gallery's entrance. In 2003, Tate St Ives initiated a pioneering residency programme at the historic Porthmeor Studios in St Ives, Cornwall, previously occupied by Borlase Smart, Ben Nicholson and Patrick Heron. Zia was the first recipient of this award and her exhibition at Tate St Ives was accompanied by a catalogue 'Entering the Visionary Zone'. Work. Early in Partou's career, landscape provided the main inspiration for her work. The quest of the individual for the divine was a developing theme. A fascination for religious iconography was manifested in depictions of the overlooked corners of church interiors. Everyday objects such as books, lamps and chairs inhabited her images of domestic scenes, suggesting a desire to capture the essence of her long lost childhood home. Her canvases at this time were dominated by an energetic application of heavily impastoed yellow, which for her represented the spiritual. Self portraits, some of them nude, also formed an important part of her oeuvre, not only as a means of asserting her identity as a woman and a painter, but in order to reveal her intuitive self. Partou's canvases bring a fresh note to the long established tradition of story telling. In scale her works range from a few inches to several feet high, with characteristic free brushwork and an immediately recognisable energetic handling of layers of paint. She has been inspired by the writing and illustrations of William Blake, and her work explores a personal journey of self discovery. Through these vibrant, painterly canvases, she draws the viewer into her dream like memory. Her own language is highly original, evolving a personal mythology of motifs and symbols that include lovers, sleepers, dreamers and readers, set within evocative interiors or luminous landscapes. The paintings from the last few months of her life reflect a change of mood. The intense energy of her earlier canvases has given way to a more contemplative application of paint, as a consequence of her failing strength. In 40 Nights and 40 Days' she reclines, in classical garb, resting her elbow on a pile of books an indication, perhaps, that her work is done. She seems to be gazing beyond the present, the outstretched hand ready to guide her on the next step of her journey.

Karaikal Airport is a greenfield airport under construction at Karaikal, in the union territory of Puducherry, India. The District Administration of Karaikal had acquired around 300 acres of land in 2013 near Nedungadu and handed over to Coimbatore based Super Airport Infrastructure Private Limited to build the airport. By August 2019, since no progress had been made in executing the project and since the licence issued to the company had expired, the district administration decided to engage CIAL, the operators of Cochin International Airport to advise it on carrying the airport project forward. History. Karaikal was touted to become the first airport in the country to be built entirely with private capital. The Air Traffic Control, however, was to be operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The greenfield project, proposed with 100% private ownership for public use, received in principle clearance from the Ministry of Civil Aviation in February 2011. Construction work was scheduled to commence in May 2013. However, the project became dormant because the promoters could not raise the minimum of 100 crores required to begin construction of the runway. The airport project site, spread across 562 acres, was to be developed by Karaikal Airport Private Limited, a subsidiary of Coimbatore based Super Airport Infrastructure Private Limited (SAPL). The first phase of construction initially envisaged the construction of an 1,800 metre runway and a terminal building capable of handling 250 passengers during peak hours at an expense of 60 crore. The airport was expected to handle airliners like the Boeing 737. Citing delays in land acquisition, the company decided to build a shorter 1,250 metre long runway in the first phase, suitable for the operation of 30 seater aircraft The company had planned to expand the airport after five years, extending the runway to 2,600 metres and increasing terminal building capacity to 500 passengers per hour. A further expansion planned ten years down the line would envisage a 3,500 metre runway and a passenger capacity of 1,000 per hour. SAPL claimed that construction is would be completed before June 2018, but August 2019, since no progress had been made in executing the project and the licence issued to the company expired, the district administration decided to engage CIAL, the operators of Cochin International Airport to advise it on carrying the airport project forward.
Albizia odoratissima, a member of the family Fabaceae, is a fast growing, deciduous tree reaching in height, a diameter of , and native to large parts of India (where it is known as , Kali siris or black siris), Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka (where it is known as Ceylon rosewood) and China. It is one of the top nitrogen fixing trees. The species' wide range of habitat, usefulness and rapid growth of about in height annually, has led to an extensive distribution in the tropics and occasionally in the temperate zones, despite young plants' being susceptible to frost. It has become naturalised over large swathes of Tropical Africa, extending from Kenya down the east coast through Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe as far south as Mozambique, and is grown in Johannesburg, South Africa. It has also become feral in Central America and Florida in the United States. It will tolerate a wide range of soil types, but does best on moist, well drained, loamy soils, and can occur from sea level to about , with an annual rainfall of . "Albizia odoratissima" has an attractive dark brown to black heartwood, often striped, durable and dense. It seasons with few problems, and works and polishes well, finding applications in structural timber, furniture and agricultural implements. In Bangladesh large areas of tea and coffee plantations are shaded by this species, while the foliage makes good cattle fodder. The species is liable to genetic degradation due to the 'extensive felling of phenotypically superior trees for commercial purposes.' The fragrant flowers are white withering to a pale orange, appearing in large terminal clusters. Mature pods are reddish brown, thin and flat, from long and wide, and contain eight to twelve reddish brown seeds, each weighing about . The bark is dark grey with horizontal lenticels. Leaves are bipinnately compound, downy, with three to nine pairs of pinnae and ten to thirty pairs of pinnules. Seeds germinate readily with a high viability, but are often damaged by "Bruchidius" beetles of the family Chrysomelidae.

Erill la Vall Descent from the Cross is a set of seven 12th century wooden sculptures from the Pyrenees village of Erill la Vall in Catalonia, originally painted, comprising a complete Romanesque Descent from the Cross sculpture group, which in Catalonia has the peculiarity that it is made up of seven figures. Two of the carvings are kept at the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC) and the rest at the Vic Episcopal Museum. Description. In the centre was the figure of Jesus Christ held by Joseph of Arimathea and unnailed by Nicodemus, flanked by the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist on either side, with the penitent and impenitent thieves, Dismas and Gestas, at the ends, respectively. The subject of the Descent adds a more narrative and dramatic feel to the representation of the Passion of Christ, and these sculptures were probably used in Medieval liturgical drama. The MNAC's collection preserves figures from the Descents of Santa Maria de Ta ll and Durro, both in the Vall de Bo (Bo Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site). The Virgin and Saint John. The monumental sculptural groups in wood of the Descent from the Cross are an important chapter in Romanesque carving in Catalonia on account of the high artistic quality of the works preserved and of the unique features of their iconography. A significant proportion comes from the Bo Valley (Vall de Bo ). One aspect that sets these Catalan series of carvings apart from other renderings of this theme is the presence of seven figures: in the centre was the figure of Christ, sustained by Joseph of Arimathea (on his right, the left for the observer) and Nicodemus on his right; on either side are Mary and St John, and at the ends the figures of the two thieves, Dismas and Gestas. The theme of the Descent brings a greater narrative and dramatic sense to the treatment of the two episodes of the Calvary and may be related to the liturgical plays of the time. But the presence of these groups in Catalonia during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as some have tried to demonstrate, could also correspond to the struggle against the heresy of Catharism. As the subject could have a Eucharistic meaning, it could be used as a reply to the Cathars' negation of the death of Christ and of the Eucharist itself. The Erill la Vall Descent is the most complete of all the known groups from the Catalan western Pyrenees, but all the figures are not exhibited together, being dispersed between the Vic Episcopal Museum and the National Art Museum of Catalonia, although the two museums sometimes loan the works out to one another to display them as a complete set. As a whole it is a masterpiece of Romanesque carving in Catalonia, to the extent that other works have been arranged around it, such as the Descent from Santa Maria de Ta ll, what remains of the one from Durro, as well as works of other types (altar frontals, crucifixes)

"Complex" listed the song at #34 on their list of the 50 best songs of 2012. At the "XXL" Awards in 2013, "New God Flow" won the award for Best Beat. Lyrical content. Pusha T confirmed in October 2012 that within the song, he was responding to a Birdman interview where the rapper dissed GOOD Music. West raps the pair of lines: "Hold up, I ain't tryna stunt, man/But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman", referencing the popularity of his Nike Air Yeezy shoes in comparison to that of the Air Jordan brand. The second line was span in his 2015 promotional single "Facts" to: "Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman". Live performances. At the 2012 BET Awards, Kanye West, Big Sean, Pusha T and 2 Chainz performed their hit single "Mercy", followed by West delivering a solo performance of his single "Cold" and then an a cappella version of his verse on "New God Flow", marking the very first preview of the song. On July 7, 2012, Kanye West performed "New God Flow" alongside Pusha T as the first performance together of the song in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On September 1, 2012, Kanye West &amp; Pusha T performed "New God Flow" during their surprise G.O.O.D. Music set at Jay Z's Made In America Festival, accompanied by Big Sean. The set also included performances of "I Don't Like (Remix)", "Can't Tell Me Nothing" &amp; "Dance (A$$)". Commercial performance. "New God Flow" performed best on the Canadian Hot 100, managing to chart at number 66 on it. The song peaked at number 89 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100.

The Big One for One Drop is a $1,000,000 buy in No Limit Texas hold 'em tournament hosted at the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Added in 2012, it became the highest buy in poker tournament in history as well as the largest single payout offered. The event is known for its charitable contributions, as $111,111 or 111,111 of each player's buy in is donated to the One Drop Foundation, an international non profit organization created by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Lalibert , which focuses on water initiatives. History. Canadian entrepreneur Guy Lalibert started the Big One for One Drop in 2012 as a No Limit hold 'em event hosted at the World Series of Poker. He founded the nonprofit One Drop Foundation, which seeks unconditional access to safe drinking water in crisis areas. Buy ins range from $111,111 for the high roller event to $1,000,000 for the Big One or 1,000,000 for the spin off Monte Carlo One Drop Extravaganza event hosted in Europe. 3.5% of the prize pool benefits the One Drop Foundation. The event was hosted at the WSOP in 2014. A smaller event known as the "High Roller for One Drop" hosted in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 has a buy in of $111,111 with $11,111 going toward charity. Antonio Esfandiari won the first event defeating Sam Trickett heads up and earned $18,346,673. In 2013, the following year, the WSOP hosted the lower buy in $111,111 High Roller event, won by Anthony Gregg. Gregg defeated Chris Klodnicki heads up and earned $4,830,619. In 2014, the $1,000,000 Big One returned. The final table consisted of professional players such as Dan Colman, Daniel Negreanu, Christoph Vogelsang, Tobias Reinkemeier and Scott Seiver as well as recreational players Paul Newey, Cary Katz and Rick Salomon. Colman won the tournament defeating Negreanu heads up and earned $15,306,668. From 2015 to 2017, One Drop only offered the lower $111,111 High Roller event at the WSOP with Jonathan Duhamel, Fedor Holz and Doug Polk winning each event respectively. In October 2016, the Big One for One Drop Extravaganza returned at a new venue held in Monte Carlo. The buy in was 1,000,000 and opened only to recreational players. Canadian Chinese poker player Elton Tsang won the event for 11,111,111 after defeating Anatoly Gurtovoy of Russia heads up. In November 2017, it was announced that the $1,000,000 buy in event would return to the 2018 World Series of Poker. 27 players entered for a total prizepool of $24,840,000, and $80,000 from each buy in donated to the One Drop foundation for a total of $2,160,000.

Recakas (Rechakas) are elements in some classical Indian dance styles that describe the minor variations in the main moves. Padma Subrahmanyam compares the Recakas with Gamakas of Carnatic music, and says that the "Gamakas are the very life of the Raga." "Recakas impearl the Nritta, make it shine and cause complete aesthetic satisfaction," says Padma Subrahmanyam. The Pada (feet) Recakas "may utilize the space on the sides, move forward, slip or glide, waver, quiver, shake, proceed, turn away, swerve, sway, get pushed, jerk, slide, raise, lower, draw, release or whirl." Padma Subrahmanyam says that Recakas "cannot be enlisted or enumerated" .
"Daylight" is a song performed by American band Maroon 5. The song was released on November 8, 2012, as the third single from their fourth studio album "Overexposed" (2012). Lead singer, Adam Levine co wrote and co produced it with Max Martin and Mason "MdL" Levy, with additional writing from Sam Martin. The song is a soft rock ballad about realizing that one has to move on from an old relationship, but not fully wanting to leave just yet. The song received a mixed reception from music critics. Some criticized Levine's vocals and called it a filler among the dance oriented tracks on the album, while others felt a Coldplay inspiration in the end of the chorus. Background and writing. "Daylight" was announced as the third single taken from the band's fourth studio album "Overexposed" (2012). It premiered on November 8, 2012, on "The Voice". "Daylight" was written by Adam Levine, Max Martin, Sam Martin and Mason "MdL" Levy, while production was handled by Levine, Martin and MdL. Levine has stated numerous times that it is his favorite track on the entire album. It is a soft rock song. Levine sings "In the daylight/ We'll be on our own/ But tonight I need to hold you so close," Helen Nowotnik of The Triangle analyzed that "If 'Never Gonna Leave This Bed' and 'Must Get Out' collided into one song, it would be 'Daylight'." The intro is the same as the Backstreet Boys' 2005 single "Just Want You to Know", as noted by Cameron Adams from "The Herald Sun". The song features additional vocals by actress Brie Larson. During her own music career, Larson had said that Maroon 5's Adam Levine was her main inspiration. Critical reception. The song received mixed reviews from most music critics. Cameron Adams of "Herald Sun" also noted that "it sounds like Max Martin trying to write a Coldplay song by recycling his Backstreet Boys handiwork. Chris Payne wrote for "Billboard" that Daylight is "a bittersweet tale that builds momentum towards one of the album's most up tempo songs that follows it; listen closely and you might hear a Chris Martin homage in Levine's 'whoa oh's'." Mesfin Fekadu from "The Huffington Post" also saw similarities, writing that the song "looks like a bad Coldplay cover." Adam Markovitz from "Entertainment Weekly" agreed, calling it "a Coldplay ish song." Markovitz also wrote that the song "has choruses so thickly produced that the only physical instrument you can reliably pick out is Levine's larynx. Not that he comes off as particularly organic either, since his voice is usually processed into a kind of high, disaffected whine like a male Rihanna or an android castrato that's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook." Helen Nowotnik of The Triangle thought that the song "It's the perfect fusion of Maroon 5's old and new sounds." Evan Sawdey of "PopMatters" wrote the song "is your big anthem that actually could've been a lot bigger had they not relied entirely on a thin drum palette during the chorus." Martyn Young from "musicOMH" complained that "By far the most irritating aspect of their magpie like approach though is the overuse of a 'Whoah, whoah, whoah' vocal which features in almost every song, including 'Daylight'." Robert Copsey of "Digital Spy" wrote that the song "feels anonymous despite its stadium sized chorus." Grace Duncan of "Under the Gun" called it "watery and uninteresting, a pop song walled in by clich d optimistic meanderings." Chart performance. "Daylight" debuted at number 70 on the ARIA Charts. "Daylight" is the band's thirteenth top 100 single and follows on from their last three consecutive tracks that all peaked at number 2 "Moves Like Jagger" (in August, 2011), "Payphone" (in June, 2012) and "One More Night" (in August, 2012). It later climbed to number 37, on November 25, 2012. The song re entered only on January 27, 2013, at number 19, becoming its peak position. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 32 on the RIANZ chart week of December 24, 2012. The following week, it climbed to number 23, remaining the position for a further week. Later, it jumped to number 19, while in its fifth week, it peaked at number 11. "Daylight" debuted at number 77 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, on the week ending December 22, 2012. The same week, it also debuted on the Adult Pop Songs, at number 37. Later, the song climbed to number 58 on the Hot 100 chart, becoming the "Greatest Gainer", on the week ending December 29, 2012. In its third week, the song gave a climb to number 46. In its eighth week, the song jumped to number 17, while in its ninth week, it climbed to number 14. In its tenth week, the song jumped to number 7, after its performance at the Grammys, becoming their seventh Hot 100 top 10 single. As of June 2014, the song has sold 2,169,000 copies in the US. In Canada, the song debuted at number 95, before climbing to number 54, becoming the "Greatest Gainer". In its sixth week, the song jumped to number 10, becoming their eighth top ten single in Canada, while being the first time that they have three top ten singles from the same album. Music videos. The Daylight Project video. On September 18, 2012, the band announced on their website: "We need YOUR help for our next music video. We're asking YOU to record and share 'YOUR story', and that recording may be handpicked to appear in the video for our third single, 'Daylight', directed by Jonas Akerlund." Levine says, "As different as we all are, there are common themes that bring us together, inspire and show everyone what is important today. With this video, we'll present the world today and beyond, creating more than just a music video." They also launched a website called "The Daylight Project" for more information and the people to submit their video. The video premiered through E! and Vevo on December 10, 2012. The accompanying music video sees fans express things they love and hate throughout the clip, after the band asked them to submit entries online. Playing for Change video. Another music video was made, titled Daylight (Playing for Change) was directed by Mark Johnson and released on the band's YouTube channel, January 17, 2013. It includes artist Chelsea Williams and several street musicians from around the world to sing along and playing instruments with scenes of Maroon 5 performing live on concert shows. Live performances. On August 14, 2012, Maroon 5 performed "Daylight" for the first time on the Overexposed Tour in Monterrey, Mexico. On November 8, 2012, the band performed "Daylight" on the of "The Voice". Later, the band was also performed the song on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" on November 12 and "Saturday Night Live" on November 17, along with "One More Night". On February 10, 2013, Maroon 5 performed "Daylight" at the 2013 Grammy Awards, on a mashup with "Girl on Fire", alongside Alicia Keys. The performance was introduced by LL Cool J, who claimed the performance was going to be "literally on fire." The performance was heavily criticized by critics in general. Samantha Martin of "Pop Dust" gave the performance 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing that she was "bored" with the performance, criticizing Alicia's onstage abilities. Martin also wrote that, "As expected, it was bland, and the interplay between 'Girl of Fire' and 'Daylight' weren't as clever or inspired as LL Cool J might have advertised." Melissa Locker of "Time" gave the performance a "C" rating, writing that "the problem is: both songs are repetitive and light on hooks mashing them together did neither song any favors." Marc Hogan of "Spin" listed the performance as one of the "worst," writing that Keys was "unfortunately below her usual standards." He criticized her for not playing her usual piano, writing that "her stint on drums still felt like an effort to signal that she, like Maroon 5, can play an Instrument. It didn't matter. It doesn't matter. It never mattered," he concluded. Credits and personnel. Credits adapted from the liner notes of "Overexposed", A&amp;M/Octone Records. Recording locations Personnel
"Love Somebody" is a song by American pop rock band Maroon 5. It was sent to US contemporary hit radio on May 14, 2013, as the fourth and final single from their fourth studio album "Overexposed" (2012). The song was written by Adam Levine, Nathaniel Motte, Ryan Tedder and Noel Zancanella; the latter two are also the producers. "Love Somebody" is a dance pop song that lyrically equates love and physical intimacy and explores "salvation on the dance floor". Upon release, the song was a respectable success on the charts and became the fourth top ten hit from the album on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Despite its success, the single received mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition, linking it to the works by Coldplay, but criticized its production and Levine's vocals. Following the release of the album, due to strong digital downloads, the song peaked at number eight on the singles chart in South Korea. Background and production. In mid 2011, Maroon 5 started working on their fourth studio album. One of the members of the band, James Valentine spoke to "Billboard" and revealed their plans to release their fourth studio album in early 2012. On March 26, 2012, the band posted a video on YouTube featuring numerous scenes from the band in the studio, recording the album. On June 26, 2012, the album was released under the title "Overexposed". The band's lead singer Adam Levine co wrote "Love Somebody" with 3OH!3 singer Nathaniel Motte, Noel Zancanella and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder. The latter two also produced it and provided programming and keys. Tedder and Zancanella also co wrote and co produced another song for "Overexposed" titled "Lucky Strike". "Love Somebody" was engineered by Smith Carlson at the Patriot Studios in Denver and Noah "Mailbox" Passovoy at the Conway Studios in Los Angeles; Eric Eylands served as the engineering assistant. Serban Ghenea mixed the song at the Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach. John Hanes served as engineer for mix, while Phil Seaford as mixing assistant. Composition. "Love Somebody" is a dance pop song with a length of three minutes and forty nine seconds. It is set in the key of C major and its instrumentation consists of piano and guitar. Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" described the song's synth hook as the Sly Stone meets Eurythmics. According to Chris Payne of "Billboard", Tedder and Zancanella's influence is all over the song and inches through the verses "before bubbling over just before the chorus kicks in." Adam Markovitz of "Entertainment Weekly" in a review of the album, wrote that the song together with "Daylight" have "thickly" produced choruses. Lyrically, "Love Somebody" equates love and physical intimacy, with Levine singing: "I really wanna love somebody [...] I really wanna touch somebody". Nate Chinen of "The New York Times" described the lyrical theme of the song as "a plea for salvation on the dance floor or some other horizontal surface". Critical reception. Suzanne Byrne of RT .ie wrote that "Love Somebody" alongside "Daylight", "The Man Who Never Lied" and "Lucky Strike" are potential single releases. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse called the song "earnest", while Cameron Adams of "Herald Sun" described it as Coldplay "trying to be" Katy Perry. Similarly as Adams, PopMatters' Evan Sawdey wrote that "Love Somebody" is the group's "sky scraping Coldplay moment". Jeremy Thomas of 411 Mania labeled the song as one of the more emotional tracks on "Overexposed" and a "rare moment where the overhanging production tricks ease up just enough to make for an honest to God song with emotion and not just a laser scope aimed at the "Billboard" charts. In a review of the album, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that the band had left "the strutting cockerel heat" of their 2004 single "This Love" for the "saturated rave bliss" of "Love Somebody" or "The Man Who Never Lied". According to him that's an effect of the market they have chosen to contribute on. "Billboard"'s Chris Payne thought that the song fades into the background of the other stronger tracks on "Overexposed". Adam Markovitz of "Entertainment Weekly" was more critical towards Levine's vocals on "Love Somebody" and wrote that the singer's voice is processed in a high disaffected whine "like a male Rihanna or an android castrato", which according to him, it's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook. Chart performance. Upon the release of "Overexposed", due to strong digital downloads, "Love Somebody" debuted on the South Korea Gaon International Chart at number eight on June 24, 2012, with sales of 35,892 digital copies. The next week, it fell to number 15 and sold an additional 16,752 copies. It stayed on the chart's top 100 for total of eight weeks. The song debuted at number 54 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and peaked at number 10, making "Overexposed" Maroon 5's first studio album to produce four Top 10 singles. As of June 2014, the song has sold 1,694,000 copies in the US. Music video. The music video for "Love Somebody", was shot in January 2013. It premiered on NBC on May 20, 2013, during the television series "The Voice" and released on Vevo, the following day. Directed by Rich Lee, the video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, with the Maroon 5 members are all covered in grey paint. Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing all while covered in grey paint. In the very last scene, Levine reverses what he has done, removing all the paint from the scene, leaving no trace of them behind. According to keyboardist PJ Morton, it involves all the members of the band including Ratajkowski, being completely covered in blue paint, he explained: "We were all painted up. But I guess what's going to happen in the video is you're just going to be able to see the paint, and not us, playing and performing." Live performances. On February 13, 2013, Maroon 5 first performed "Love Somebody" on their Overexposed Tour in Columbus, Ohio. The band performed "Love Somebody" at the 2013 edition of Wango Tango on May 11. The band continued with the song during their appearances on the of "The Voice" (May 20) and "The Today Show" (June 14, 2013), respectively. On September 21, 2013, Maroon 5 also performed the song at 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. Credits and personnel.

The WRKY domain is found in the WRKY transcription factor family, a class of transcription factors. The WRKY domain is found almost exclusively in plants although WRKY genes appear present in some diplomonads, social amoebae and other amoebozoa, and fungi incertae sedis. They appear absent in other non plant species. WRKY transcription factors have been a significant area of plant research for the past 20 years. The WRKY DNA binding domain recognizes the W box (T)TGAC(C/T) (and variants of this sequence) cis regulatory element. Structure. WRKY transcription factors contain either one or two WRKY protein domains. The WRKY protein domain is 60 to 70 amino acids long type of DNA binding domain. The domain is characterized by a highly conserved core WRKYGQK motif and a zinc finger region. The cysteine and histidine zinc finger domain occurs as a CX4 5CX22 23HXH or CX7CX23HXC type, where X can be any amino acid. The zinc finger binds a Zn+2 ion, which is required for protein function. While the WRKYGQK is highly conserved in most WRKY domains, variation in the core sequence has been documented. A frequently occurring variant of the core sequence is WRKYGKK, which is present in most plant species. The structure of the WRKY protein domain was first determined in 2005 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and later by crystallography. The WRKY protein domain is a globular shape composed of five anti parallel strands. The core WRKYGQK motif is found on the second strand. Eighteen amino acids are highly conserved in the WRKY protein domain, including the core motif, zinc finger binding cysteines and histidines, and a triad forming a DWK salt bridge. The triad consist of a conserved tryptophan (W) of the core motif, along with an aspartic acid (D) four amino acids upstream and a lysine (K) 29 amino acids downstream of it, stabilizing the entire domain. Five amino acids on the third strand (PRSYY) are also well conserved in the WRKY domain. Importantly, the WRKY genes contain a conserved intron in the WRKY domain, which occurs at the location encoding for the PR of the PRSYY amino acid sequence, thus explaining the conservation of this motif. WRKY DNA Interaction. The WRKY domain forms a unique wedge shaped structure that enters perpendicularly in the major groove of the DNA strand. WRKY protein domains interact with the (T/A)TGAC(T/A) cis element, also called the W box. Recent evidence suggests that the GAC core of the W box is the primary target of the WRKY domain and flanking sequences help dictate DNA interaction with very specific WRKY proteins. The RKYGQK residues of the core motif and additional arginine and lysine residues of the WRKY domain are responsible for interaction with the phosphate backbone of seven consecutive DNA base pairs, including the GAC core. Changing the tryptophan, tyrosine, or either lysine of the WRKYGQK motif to alanine completely abolishes DNA binding, indicating these amino acids are essential for recognizing the W box element. While not essential, altering the WRKYGQK motif arginine, glycine or glutamine to alanine reduces DNA binding to the W box. Overall, these complex WRKY protein domain DNA interactions results in gene activation necessary for numerous aspects of plant development and defense.

Social artistry is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity. Social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change. While a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world, a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities. Thus, the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression. Social artists may address issues such as youth alienation or the breakdown of communities. Most commonly, social artists will address these problems by helping people express themselves and find their voice, or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other. Social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including theatre, poetry, music and visual art. Findings from 2013 confirm the shift from individual expression to community engagement, or "from autonomous to socially engaged." Lingo and Tepper cite several examples:
Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution (SCSR) () is a Syrian opposition group supporting the overthrow of the Bashar al Assad government in Syria during the Syrian civil war. It grants local opposition groups representation in its national organisation. One of three national opposition groups the other two being the Local Coordination Committees (LCCs) and Syrian Revolution General Commission (SRGC) the SCSR has been described as catering to young protesters and being different from the other two groups in its political position. It sets "outlines for a political solution while also recognising the importance of armed struggle". Unlike the SRGC it has sent representatives to Syrian National Council (SNC) exile group meetings, and unlike the LCCs it is not formally a member of the Syrian National Council. The group was classed as amongst the "most active" by think tank Mediterranean Affairs in 2019.

Jean Baptiste Qu ruel (23 November 1779 20 June 1845) was the inventor of the method for industrial production of sugar from beet. Qu ruel was born on 23 November 1779 in Normandy at the hamlet of La Perroch re in Saint Quentin les Chardonnets, the son of Jacques Queruel and Marie Anne Lebarb (or Lebarbey). Around the beginning of the 19th century, Qu ruel was hired by Benjamin Delessert in his sugar factory at Passy, where he succeeded, by the end of 1811, in developing the process that would lead to the manufacture of sugar on an industrial scale from sugar beet, giving for the first time the impetus for the mass production this new sort of sugar. Qu ruel had married, on 22 April 1815 in Paris, Fran oise Marie Lebaudy, the daughter of Pierre and Marie Jeanne Lebaudy Gallier, and the cousin of the prominent Lebaudy family of sugar makers. He died on 20 June 1845 in his home of La Bicheti re, in Tinchebray, and was buried with his wife in the cemetery of Les Montiers. His birthplace is still existant. A street of Tinchebray was given his name. https://gaia.orne.fr/mdr/index.php/docnumViewer/calculHierarchieDocNum/372329/1057:358363:371981:372329/1080/1920

The blinking twelve problem is a term used in software design. It usually refers to features in software or computer systems which are rendered unusable to most users by the complexity of the interface to them. The usage emanates from the 'clock' feature provided on many VCRs manufactured in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The clock could be set by using a combination of buttons provided on the VCR in a specific sequence that was found complicated by most users. As a result, VCR users were known to seldom set the time on the VCR clock. This resulted in the default time of '12:00' blinking on the VCR display at all times of the day, which is the origin of this term. "In most surveys, the majority of people have never time shifted just because they don't know how to program their machines," said Tom Adams, a television analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm, in 1990. In software, 'the blinking twelve problem' thus refers to any situation in which features or functions of a program go unused for reasons that the designers never anticipated, largely because developers were unable to anticipate the level of understanding the users would have of the technology. The term may also refer to the challenge faced by developers of addressing the real causes of users' difficulties, as well as the challenge of providing helpful documentation or technical support without knowing beforehand how well the user understands their own problem. In other instances, it can be used to reference the lack of basic user friendly features in complex systems; stemming from the lack of a backup battery to keep the clock setting in a $300 VCR during even the briefest power interruption, when a $10 clock would have one. The term appears in the 1999 essay In the Beginning... Was the Command Line by Neal Stephenson.

He also has a one off sexual encounter with his ex girlfriend and later with a girl who turned him down when he was a teenager. Meanwhile, he regularly meets "Marla", his sexfriend. In order to seduce more girls, he learns how to play the guitar. At the beginning, it was just a way to hit on girls but it soon becomes a hobby, and he finally performs at concert, using the stage name "Amer de toi" (Bitter about you). The hero and his brother Keyvan are really close, to such an extent that they understand each other at a simple glance and hardly need to talk to communicate. "I" often calls his brother to get advice or to be reassured. Their parents get divorced because of the unfaithfulness of the father, who had an affair with a student. After realizing that his love for the student is not reciprocated, the narrator's father ends up alone before settling in his son's flat, much to the chagrin of the latter. Finally, the father moves into another flat in the same apartment block. Keyvan decides to move in with the love of his life and therefore enables "I" to occupy his flat after a catastrophic flat sharing with Baptiste, who never does any housework or tidies up. But fate is not on his side. Keyvan's girlfriend decides to break up, and so the hero has to live with his father because Baptiste has already found a new room mate. The hero is still in love with "this girl" (Sarah), and approaches her bit by bit. He despairs of ever making a real connection with her until the day she invites him to come over. They eventually kiss each other. They start a relationship and settle in a new flat. During this time, Marla attempts to meet up with "I", but ends up meeting Sarah. Facing to them, "I" has to make a choice and decides to stay with Sarah. Over time, "I" and Sarah become distant from one another, and after getting drunk at a bar, he cheats on her. He keeps it as a secret until another party, where he unleashes his anger and confesses his resentment against his friends and finally hits an uninvited guest. He leaves the party and tries to renew his relationship with Marla, but she has already found herself another man. Finally, after a depression, "I" moves in with Baptiste again and resumes the boring life he had before meeting Sarah. Reception.

Delphine Djiraibe (born 1 December 1960) is a Chadian attorney and co founder of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights.In 2006 she also founded the Public Interest Law Center (PILC). BBC News has described her as "one of Chad's most prominent human rights lawyers". In 2004, she was awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award for her work. Early life and education.

The event motivated her to become a human rights activist and found the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. Human rights work. Djiraibe's work particularly focuses on revenues from the World Bank funded Chad Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project. Djiraibe argues that revenue from the pipeline should be used to support local development rather than the Chadian military, and that the pipeline project further impoverished the villages of its region: "Their lands have been taken for the oil project. They get compensation but without preparation. The cash that they have received has been expended like that and now they find themselves with nothing." Djiraibe also has argued that oil revenues were a factor in the nation's 2005 2010 civil war, calling them a "curse". According to the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, Djiraibe's activism caused the Chadian government to begin a public relations campaign against her. Djiraibe decisively lobbied the World Bank to provide restrictions on the Chadian government spending oil revenue. In 2008, during a widespread crackdown by Deby on his political opponents, a campaign began to guarantee Djiraibe safe passage out of Chad. She was ultimately allowed to travel to Paris. Djiraibe was a critic of the Organisation of African Unity, calling it "irrelevant" and "a private club for friends". She supported the 2005 trial of former president Habr , stating that the case showed "that Africa can also play a role in the fight for human rights and can fight on its own soil." Recognition. In 2005, the Robert F. Kennedy Center awarded Djiraibe the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, praising "her tireless efforts in promoting the human rights of the Chadian people, often at great personal risk to herself and her family." Four years later, the magazine "Jeune Afrique" named her one of Africa's 100 most important advocates for change, writing, "This attorney and tireless fighter for human rights has the obstinacy of those who call out in the desert. In 2009, will she be heard?"

In molecular biology, the WAC domain is a protein domain found on the N terminus of WSTF protein. Its function is still unknown, but putatively thought to be involved in cell growth. The protein domain has been found to be present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes Function. The function of the WAC domain remains to be fully elucidated but it is thought to be part of the process of chromatin assembly, critical for the proper growth and maintenance of cells. ACF (for ATP utilising chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) is a chromatin remodeling complex that catalyzes the ATP dependent assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays. This reaction utilises the energy of ATP hydrolysis by ISWI, the smaller of the two subunits of ACF. Acf1, the large subunit of ACF, is essential for the full activity of the complex. Structure. The WAC (WSTF/Acf1/cbp146) domain is a 110 amino acid module present at the N termini of WSTF, Acf1 and cbp146 related proteins in a variety of organisms. It is found in association with other domains such as the bromodomain, the PHD type zinc finger, DDT or WAKS. The DNA binding region of Acf1 includes the WAC domain, which is necessary for the efficient binding of ACF complex to DNA. It seems probable that the WAC domain will be involved in DNA binding in other related factors. Examples of proteins containing WAC. Proteins known to contain a WAC domain are:

Kennedy's speeches in which she wrote, "To Kevin Tucker, whose humor and intelligence made our time together so memorable and missed." Philadelphia Police Commissioner. By the mid 1980s, the Philadelphia Police Department was reeling from multiple scandals. Thirty officers, including high ranking members of the department, had been convicted of extortion of brothels and illicit gambling rings, as well as other incidents of corruption, between 1982 and 1986 alone. Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode created an independent task force to evaluate the police department and potential reforms. The task force, in its findings, called the department, "unfocused, unmanaged, unaccountable, undertrained, underequipped." The preceding Police Commissioner, Gregore J. Sambor, had resigned after the May 1985 standoff and bombing of the MOVE house in West Philadelphia. Sambor had ordered that a bomb be dropped from a helicopter on the house to destroy a rooftop bunker. The bombing killed 11 people, and the ensuing fire destroyed 61 neighborhood houses. Sambor resigned in the aftermath of the fire. Tucker had recently retired from the Secret Service by 1985 when Mayor Wilson Goode asked him to become Police Commissioner. Tucker accepted Wilson's offer, becoming the first Commissioner to be chosen from outside the Philadelphia Police Department since the 1920s. Tucker's appointment was initially opposed by several internal candidates within the department who wanted the position. His appointment was also opposed by the President of the police union, Robert Hurst, who a year after Tucker's arrival, "I fought like hell to keep him out... but the man came in and literally turned the department around." Tucker implemented numerous reforms within the department, many of which are still in use today. He reintroduced uniformed foot patrols (now called community policing) to the city's neighborhoods, explaining, "I think the Police Department has a responsibility to try to foster a partnership with the community...It is very difficult to establish a relationship with a patrol car that is driving past at 30 miles an hour." He opened mini police stations in high crime neighborhoods, reformed the work schedule to send more officers to problem areas, and offered Spanish language classes to police officers to better serve the Hispanic communities. Tucker introduced standardized rules regarding police abuses. He replaced defective police equipment with new computers (Staff had sometimes had to bring personal typewriters to work in order to complete paperwork). Tucker also sent approximately fifty police commanders for three week training courses and seminars at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He further improved the previously poor relations between the department and the local media. Tucker retired from the police department in June 1988 to take a position as vice president of PNC Bank. He was succeeded by a close department prot g , Willie L. Williams. Later life. Tucker was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1990. He was initially told he had six months to live, but fortunately lived with the diagnosis for decades. He served on the board of the Wistar Institute for twelve years, including a tenure as board chairman from 1998 to 2005. Tucker died at Samaritan Hospice Inpatient Center at Virtua Memorial Hospital in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey, on June 19, 2012, at the age of 71. He was survived by his wife, Judy; children, Kevin and Christine; three brothers John, William and Edmund; his sister, Kathleen Cardigan; and four grandchildren. His funeral was held at St. Mary of the Lakes Church in Medford, New Jersey, and he was buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey.
Alfred Flechtheim (1 April 1878 9 March 1937) was a German Jewish art dealer, art collector, journalist and publisher persecuted by the Nazis. Early years. Flechtheim was born into a Jewish merchant family; his father, Emil Flechtheim, was a grain dealer. Alfred became a partner in his father's company after business internships in London and Paris. Art collector. Flechtheim appeared in the art world shortly after 1900, with a collection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh, Paul C zanne; French Avant garde early works of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Andr Derain; paintings of Wassily Kandinsky, Maurice de Vlaminck, Alexej von Jawlensky, Gabriele M nter, and the Rhein Expressionists Heinrich Campendonk, August Macke, Heinrich Nauen, and . 1912 Sonderbund in Cologne. Flechtheim organised The Internationale Kunstausstellung des Sonderbunds Westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und K nstler' that opened in Cologne on 25 May, 1912. Known as the Sonderbund, the exhibition brought together all avant garde groups of artists and art movements in Europe (Expressionism, The Br cke, The Blauer Reiter, Fauvism, Cubism) for the first time. Flechtheim was the chairman of the steering committee and the lender of many important artworks by Picasso and other artists Art Dealer. Flechtheim opened his first gallery in D sseldorf in 1913, followed by galleries in Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne, and Vienna. Flechtheim served in the German Army during World War I, but not at the front. His art business collapsed during the war but he re opened in D sseldorf in 1919. Legendary, glamorous parties in Flechtheim's gallery overflowed with the glitterati of the new Berlin: movie stars, titans of finance, prizefighters and artists of every stripe. He founded the important modernist art journal "Der Querschnitt" ("The Cross Section") which ran from 1921 until 1936. Flechtheim, Nazis and Aryanization. As soon as the Nazis came into power, in 1933, Flechtheim was persecuted and his business attacked. In 1933, Nazi Sturmabteilung men broke up an auction of Flechtheim's paintings. In March 1933, an art dealer named Alexander V mel, a member of the SA or Brown Shirts, confiscated Flechtheim's D sseldorf gallery. The Nazis aryanized Flechtheim's gallery, as they would many other Jewish businesses. After the war, former Nazi party member V mel claimed he didn't even remember who Flechtheim was. Flechtheim's former assistant, Curt Valentin, left the Flechtheim Gallery in 1934 and began working in the Berlin gallery of Karl Buchholz, who was authorized by Hitler and Goering to sell confiscated art to raise cash for the Nazis. The Nazis seized and sold off Flechtheim's private collection, as well as the contents of his gallery. Emigration and death. Six months after the Nazis came to power in 1933, Flechtheim, penniless, fled to Paris, and tried to find work with his former business partner, Daniel Henry Kahnweiler and with the Mayor Gallery in London. Flechtheim subsequently organized exhibits in London of the paintings of exiled German artists. On August 8, 1935, Flechtheim wrote Alfred Barr of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City a letter informing him, I lost all my money and all my pictures. By November 1936, Flechtheim's former gallery assistant, Curt Valentin, had made a deal with the Nazis that would allow him to emigrate to New York and to sell degenerate art to help fund the Nazi war effort. In January 1937, with financing from Buchholz, Valentin left for New York and set up the Karl Buchholz Gallery at 3 West 46th Street which was later accused of serving as a conduit for bringing Nazi looted art, including paintings that had been seized from Flechtheim, into America. In March 1937 in London, Flechtheim slipped on a patch of ice, was taken to a hospital, punctured his leg on a rusty nail in his hospital bed, developed sepsis leading to amputation of his leg, and died. The Galerie Alfred Flechtheim GmbH disappeared in its entirety on 27 March 1937. Personal life. Flechtheim married Betty Goldschmidt, a wealthy Dortmund merchant's daughter. On a honeymoon trip to Paris, Flechtheim invested Betty's dowry in cubist art, to the horror of his inlaws. The marriage was childless. Betty Flechtheim was with her husband in London during his final days. Then she returned to Berlin. In 1941, when she was ordered to report for deportation to Minsk, she ingested a lethal dose of Veronal. The Gestapo seized her art collection. Professor Ossip K. Flechtheim, who in mid 1940s coined the term "Futurology", and later became a director of Otto Suhr Institut in West Berlin, was Alfred Flechtheim's nephew. Recovery of artworks. Flechtheim's heirs are attempting to recover artworks stolen from Flechtheim. These works reside in German museums and the Museum of Modern Art. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's "Das Soldatenbad" (1915) remained in the custody of Flechtheim's niece Rosi Hulisch in Berlin. It was acquired in 1938 by Kurt Feldh usser, a member of the Nazi party. Upon Feldh usser's death in 1945, the ownership of his collection passed to his mother, who brought the work to the United States and consigned it to the Weyhe Gallery in New York in 1949. It was then purchased by American philanthropist and collector Morton D. May of Saint Louis in 1952. May amassed one of the largest collections of German Expressionist art in America and donated over one thousand works from his collection to various institutions; Das Soldatenbad was donated to The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1956. In an exchange in 1988, the work became part of the collection of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. In 2018 Das "Soldatenbad" was restituted to the heirs of Alfred Flechtheim by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation after an extensive examination of the circumstances surrounding the painting's history. In November 2018, it sold at Sotheby's for $21,975,800 (including fees). Oskar Kokoschka's "Joseph de Montesquiou Fezensac" (1910) was sold by Alex V mel to the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm where it would later be transferred to the Moderna Museet. It remained in the Moderna Museet's collection until 2018, when it was restituted to Flechtheim's heirs. In November 2018, it sold at Sotheby's for $20,395,200 (including fees).

The 1820 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election occurred on October 10, 1820. Incumbent Democratic Republican governor William Findlay sought re election but was defeated by U.S. Representative Joseph Hiester. Findlay entered the race with significantly reduced popularity. He had been renounced in the press as an opponent of democracy due to his nomination during the 1817 campaign by a group of party insiders. He additionally faced allegations of corruption over the misappropriation of funds during his tenure as State Treasurer, although all charges were dismissed during impeachment proceedings before the State Legislature. For this campaign, Findlay was chosen for a slot on the ballot at a popular convention of Democratic Republicans; Hiester was selected at a separate convention of Federalists and "Old School Democrats" (i.e. allies of former governor Thomas McKean). The sour state of the economy was a key factor in the defeat of the incumbent, as Pennsylvania was reeling from the effects of the Panic of 1819.

The 1817 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election occurred on October 14, 1817. Incumbent Democratic Republican governor Simon Snyder was not a candidate for re election. Simon's preferred successor, State Treasurer William Findlay, was nominated as the Democratic Republican candidate by a caucus of legislative leaders. Conversely, U.S. Representative Joseph Hiester was chosen as a candidate by the Democratic Republicans' first popular nominating convention; he additionally gained the endorsement of the declining Federalists. The two men ran starkly different campaigns. Findlay sought to continue aggressive policies of infrastructural investment and economic intervention while maintaining the patronage system for governmental employment. Hiester, a former Revolutionary War captain, called for a reduction in spending, an expansion in liberal economic policies, and an investigation into corruption in state government. Findlay was ultimately victorious by an approximately six point margin, as his dominance in the state's rural counties counteracted support for Hiester in the cities.

German submarine "U 61" was a Type IIC U boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" that served in the Second World War. It was built by Deutsche Werke AG, Kiel. Ordered on 21 June 1937, it was laid down on 1 October as yard number 260. It was launched on 15 June 1939 and commissioned on 12 August under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" J rgen Oesten. "U 61" was initially assigned to the 5th U boat Flotilla during its training period, until 1 January 1940, when it was reassigned to the 1st flotilla for a front line combat role. "U 61" carried out eleven war patrols, sinking five ships for a total of and damaging one of 4,434 tons. It then joined the 21st flotilla as a 'school' or training boat in November 1940 where it remained for the rest of the war. It was scuttled at Wilhelmshaven in May 1945. Design. German Type IIC submarines were enlarged versions of the original Type IIs. "U 61" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. Officially, the standard tonnage was , however. The U boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MWM RS 127 S four stroke, six cylinder diesel engines of for cruising, two Siemens Schuckert PG VV 322/36 double acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . "U 61" was fitted with three torpedo tubes at the bow, five torpedoes or up to twelve Type A torpedo mines, and a anti aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of 25. Service history. 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th patrols. The U boat began her first patrol in the North Sea, keeping to the Norwegian side. She departed Kiel on 24 October 1939 and returned there on 14 November. It was uneventful. Her second effort started in Kiel on 28 November 1939 but finished in Wilhelmshaven on 3 December. Patrol number three was the reverse of number two starting from Wilhelmshaven and finishing in Kiel. Her fourth patrol continued the start/finish changing; starting in Kiel on 15 January 1940 and was terminated in Wilhelmshaven on the 30th. In between she sank the "Sydfold" about east of John O Groats on the 22nd. 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th patrols. "U 61"s fifth sortie was marked by the sinking of the "Sangstad" east of Kirkwall (in the Orkney Islands), on 18 February 1940. She had left Wilhelmshaven on 12 February and along with five other U boats, took part in Operation "Nordmark", a reconnaissance mission for the German capital ships , and (for what proved to be an unsuccessful sortie). It took place in the vicinity of the Orkney and Shetland Islands between 18 and 20 February. Her sixth patrol was uneventful, but her seventh foray included a brief stop in the Norwegian port of Bergen, before moving through the gap between the Faroe and Shetland Islands to the waters almost between mainland Scotland and the Western Isles. The return journey was the reverse of the outbound. At 27 days, it was also her longest patrol. She docked in Kiel on 7 May. "U 61"s eighth patrol involved moving slightly further south off the western Northern Irish coast. She returned to Bergen on 1 July 1940. 9th patrol. For her ninth patrol she departed Bergen on 6 July 1940 and sank "Alwaki" on the 10th. The ship was hit about northeast of Cape Wrath (the north west most point on the Scottish mainland), by two torpedoes that failed to detonate. But they did create holes large enough to allow the water in. The vessel sank about eleven hours after being hit. The Admiralty investigation into the sinking wrongly concluded that the ship had been sabotaged. The boat also sank "Scottish Minstrel" north west of the Bloody Foreland (on the Irish mainland), on the 16th. "U 61" returned to Kiel, arriving on the 25th. 10th and 11th patrols. The boat's tenth patrol involved negotiating the Faroer/Shetland gap once again before docking at Lorient in occupied France on 15 September 1940. Her eleventh and final war patrol was in the other direction. She arrived at the port where she had commenced her war career, Kiel, on 10 October 1940.
The 2007 Leeds City Council election took place on Thursday 3 May 2007 to elect members of Leeds City Council in England. As per the election cycle, one third of the council's 99 seats were contested. Those seats up for election were those of the second placed candidate elected for every ward at the 2004 all out election, who had been granted a three year term to expire in 2007. Despite Labour gaining three council seats, the council remained in no overall control as no political party had an overall majority of councillors. In coalition since 2004, the Liberal Democrat and Conservative council administration continued. Election result. This result had the following consequences for the total number of seats on the council after the elections:

The Royal Artillery Band was the first official, and permanent British military band (and former symphony orchestra) originating in 1557, but granted official status in 1762. Consisting of woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments (and until 2014, also stringed instruments), it represented both the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and the state. The Royal Artillery Orchestra (of the Royal Artillery Band) [disbanded on 9 February 2014] was Britain's first permanent professional orchestra. All other bands in the British Army received official, permanent status from 1763 onward. Now that the band's overall history of over four and a half centuries has come to an end, it is now claimed that the Band of the Grenadier Guards are the oldest band, with their overall history of over three hundred and thirty years. It is however, important to consider that until 1762, all military bands were formed as and when required, and then immediately disbanded when not, and that they consisted only of hired, civilian musicians. It was announced on 30 July 2013 that the Royal Artillery Orchestra would cease to exist in favour of a forthcoming "State String Orchestra", now known as "The Countess of Wessex's String Orchestra" following the most recent cuts to Army Music. On Sunday 9 February 2014, the Royal Artillery Band, and a specially formed 'Veterans of the Royal Artillery Band' paraded on General Gordon's Square for the last time in their home town of Woolwich, thus ending a 252 year era, before relocating to join their regiment at Tidworth Barracks, Wiltshire The Band spent Christmas 2013 in Afghanistan, where they carried out their wartime role, as well as continuing to entertain the troops, and accompanying such celebrities as Gary Barlow, and Katherine Jenkins. Its former accommodation in the historic Georgian Royal Artillery Barracks is now the home of the 24 piece Countess of Wessex's String Orchestra. In October 2019, it was announced that the band would relocate, to become one of the member bands of British Army Bands Tidworth. History. The Royal Artillery Band served as the musical arm of the artillery branch of the British Army (the Royal Regiment of Artillery). In May 1660, the Lifeguards had their 'unofficial' kettledrums and trumpets. They also formed a band proper in 1763 after the end of the Seven Years' War. The First Foot Guards had their 'unofficial' fifes and drums in 1685 (some accounts state 1665), but their band proper was not founded until 1783 along with two other "bands of the Foot Guards". As the Grenadier Guards were not formed until after the Battle of Waterloo (from surviving troops of the First and Second Foot Guards), any claim to a band of the Grenadier Guards must be regarded as incorrect, and there are no accounts available of continuity between any Guards band which may have existed, and that of today's Grenadier Guards. It was announced in a press release by CAMUS on 29 July 2013, that all orchestral capability in British Army bands would be terminated in favour of a new 24 piece state string orchestra, formed from a nucleus of ex Royal Artillery strings players, who had been temporarily held, in various Guards bands during the establishment period of the orchestra, and newly recruited ex civilian string players. The new orchestra has subsequently been named "The Countess of Wessex String Orchestra". The Royal Artillery Band and the Royal Artillery Orchestra (Britain's first, and oldest permanent orchestra) are significant in the history of British music, and in particular, of British military music, as being two of the oldest permanent musical organizations in the world, and can trace their origins as far back as 1557. The Band is closely linked to the English Artillerymen (Honourable Artillery Company), and the subsequent formation of the English Artillery regiments, which would eventually become the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and for the rise of the Royal Horse Artillery at the command of the Duke of Marlborough, and later also for the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery (formerly the Riding Troop). Origins. The first documented accounts of music in the "English Artillery" date back to 1557 at the battle of St. Quentin, where the Artillery had their "drumme and phife "(or fyffe)"". Bands known as 'Hoboys' ("Fr." "hautbois" = oboes) of the French Horse Grenadiers appeared throughout the English cavalry and foot guards regiments during campaigns, but were disbanded immediately afterwards, as "surplus to requirements". The regiment did however, appoint permanent drummers at least from 1751, because the Royal Clothing Warrant of that year states that the drummers "were clothed in red. lined, faced, and lapelled on the breast with blue, and laced with the royal lace" (i.e. 'royal livery' as still worn today by the Household Cavalry Band). The royal lace is a 22 karat gold braid with two thin purple stripes. The English Artillery's (civilian) musicians expanded into an eight piece ensemble consisting of 4 oboes and 4 bassoons, with each of the musicians required to also perform at Court on a stringed instrument, and increasingly at regimental dinners. The eight musicians were hired by the officers of the regiment, and disbanded after every event. It wasn't until 1762, that a total of eight musicians would be hired permanently by the Regiment, when the Royal Artillery Band was 'officially' formed at Minden, Germany. In 1717 twenty (civilian) musicians eight wind instrumentalists and twelve drummers from the 'Artillerie' list augmented the Royal Band of King George II aboard a barge on the River Thames, situated "close to the Royal Barge" for the first performance of the "Water Music", by George Frideric Handel. The 'English' Artillery (the title 'Royal' was first used in the Regiment's appellation in 1720) raised additional musicians on "ad hoc" terms for occasions such as these, reverting immediately afterwards to the permanent eight. The composer Handel once again enlisted the musical services of the 'Artillerie' [Royal Artillery] on 27 April 1749 at the Royal Fireworks in Green Park. [The number of musicians augmenting the Royal Band on that occasion is unspecified, but particular mention of the "Artillerie kettledrums (of a particularly large pattern)" is nevertheless well documented. Kettledrums were confined to royal events in those days, and only the Lifeguards otherwise used kettledrums, but of the standard size, or in battle. In Germany, all kettledrummers were licensed to play them, and had to belong to the Guild of Kettledrummers]. The King had also requested that "no fi" "els (stringed instruments) be used", but the composer wrote on the score that all the oboe and bassoon parts should be doubled on strings (these players were again drafted from the Artillery) thereby confirming Handel's defiant intention to use string players regardless of the King's express wish. Prior to those given by Handel, all public performances of music in England were arranged directly by the Church, with the exceptions of processional music (royal, and military), and music for recruiting purposes. These performances of Handel's music are the first recorded in Britain, that were not connected to the Church, and among the first in Europe. Their popularity gave rise to occasional concerts before fee paying audiences, and eventually to the existence of the first civilian professional orchestras, and the building of public concert halls. At the formation of the now 'Royal Artillery' regiment in 1720, a special unit of artillerymen which had been in existence since 1537 by royal charter, and which incorporated the Artillery Pikemen who date back to c. 1450 the Honourable Artillery Company was designated a ceremonial role, and in this capacity, they continue to exist, still maintaining their own band, the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company. The Honourable Artillery Company (now part of the British Army Reserve) is the oldest regiment in continuous service in the British Army (the Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey, were formed 1337 but had a break in service to the crown from 1946 to 1987). The Honourable Artillery Company have always maintained through their ceremonial duties, close links with the Brigade of Guards. The Honourable Artillery's regimental band recruits a large number of ex serving regular army musicians from the Royal Artillery, Corps of Royal Engineers and Guards as well as civilians with no previous military background. Apart from their source of musicians, there is no connection between the Honourable Artillery Company, and the Royal Artillery. In 1830 King William IV decreed that the HAC's ceremonial uniform should be modelled on that of the Grenadier Guards. The HAC are regarded as a City of London regiment, being the closest Territorial Army regiment to the "Square Mile"'. All City of London regiments (the oldest of these being the Royal Fusiliers) are entitled to wear red tunic and pelt headdress on parade. The origin of these pikemen in fact predates the formation, in 1485 under the reign of King Henry VII, of the 'Yeoman of the Guard of the State' (the Royal Bodyguard) and of the Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London (the Palace and Fortress Guard), whose identical livery is based closely on that of the pikemen of the period, from a time when helmets (rather than the Tudor hat), and breastplates were worn by all three bodies. The Yeoman Warders broke away from the body of the Yeoman of the Guard when the king gave up his residence at the Tower of London, which remained a royal palace, and therefore still required royal guards. One can readily identify the Yeoman of the Guard by their shoulder belts on an otherwise identical livery. The original kettledrums of the Royal Regiment of Artillery were of a uniquely large pattern, and were mounted on a carriage, designed especially for the purpose, modelled on the already extant Prussian drum carriages, and which were drawn by six white horses. The first appearance of the carriage was during the Williamite War in Ireland of 1689. In 1751 the drums were described as being painted blue at the forefront, with rims in red, and carrying the arms of Great Britain. In 1772 the carriage was employed at the funeral of the first Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill. Until 1756 it remained in permanent use, and stored in the Tower of London (where the artillery guns were made), where it was eventually destroyed by fire in the mid nineteenth century. The uniform worn by the kettle drummer, the driver, and the leader, was not the usual uniform of the Royal Artillery. Instead, they wore court livery, as is still seen worn by the drum majors and mounted musicians of the Household Cavalry, on royal and state occasions . The entitlement of the Royal Artillery Band to wear court livery (or state dress) still remains, though nowadays it is never exercised, and is largely forgotten. A painting by J. Wootton, in the possession of Her Majesty the Queen and dated at around 1759, shows the drum carriage bearing the Artillery kettledrums, with the kettledrummer, driver, and rider dressed in state dress, and likewise, two mounted trumpeters halted behind the carriage. However, today's Royal Artillery [State] Band does maintain the distinction of being the only band in which each and every one of its musicians wears, as part of his ceremonial uniform, a band sword at the waist. These distinctive short swords were presented to the Band by the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. Band swords have been worn by other regiments' bands, and indeed by bandsmen in foreign bands, traditionally for the purpose of personal defence during active duty, in their non combatant role. The Royal Artillery Band is also the British Army's only band whose members wear gold belts and gold crossbelts (all other bands wear white, where a crossbelt forms part of the uniform, apart from the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals and now amalgamated Royal Corps of Transport who wear a crossbelt containing a high proportion of gold), as well as a uniquely styled musician's lyre badge, rather than the standard army bandsman's lyre. In 1994, because of the Royal Artillery Band's role supporting the ceremonial duties of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, it was granted permanent "State" status, thereby becoming the eighth, and only non Household Division band to carry that status. It is for this reason that the Band continued to remain at Woolwich instead of relocating with the Regiment to Larkhill the new permanent home of the Royal Regiment. On 7 February 2012, the King's Troop relocated from St. Johns Wood, to Woolwich. The Royal Artillery Band had however, assumed temporary State status on a number of significant occasions during the past. The Band will cease to be a State band in 2014, when, owing to funding cuts announced in 2013 in Army Music, it will lose its string capability, be reduced in number, and relocate to Tidworth, in Hampshire. Both the Royal Regiment and the Royal Artillery Band have always been particularly important to the British monarchs, since the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), first regularly sang with the Band. It was George IV who was responsible for the Royal Artillery Orchestra's regular concerts, given at Windsor Castle the first concerts in Britain performed by a professional orchestra (leading to the famous Woolwich Town Hall concerts, which continued until 2011). Indeed, Her Majesty the Queen, Queen Elizabeth II, as well as holding the honorary rank of Colonel In Chief of several other regiments, also holds the prestigious rank of "Captain General" both of the Royal Artillery and of the Honourable Artillery Company. Fifers were added at the instigation of the officers of the Regiment to the Royal Artillery Corps of Drummers in 1748 on a permanent basis, and this unit continued until after the Crimean War, when it became a bugle band. It soon became apparent that the musicians were becoming bored with the limited five note compass of the instrument, and so they persuaded the instrument maker, Henry Distin to supply them with sets of his newly patented chromatic attachments, to enable the bugle to have the same compass as the cornet. This proved very successful, particularly after the furore created on Woolwich Front Parade, when two buglers performed the Mess Call, playing 'The Roast Beefe of Olde England' in (inadvertent) two part harmony. From that time, the 'keyed bugle' went into production. In Europe, and among the English troops, fifers, drummers (and pipers) have always been fighting soldiers, acting additionally as stretcher bearers as necessary. There is no record, however, that this was ever the case in the Royal Artillery. Towards the end of the Seven Years' War "(1756 1763)", the 'modern' Royal Artillery Band was founded and formed by Lieutenant Colonel W. Phillips, at the Battle of Minden (1759) in Germany. It was granted official status in 1762. Phillips had much experience of seeing and listening to the Prussian bands, on which he unsurprisingly modelled his band. By the following year, the (German) musicians of whom one, John Michael Bach, was the son of the third cousin to Johann Sebastian Bach were now permanent paid members of the British Army, stationed at Woolwich, to the south east of London, at the home of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. Prior to this period all bands were raised only for special occasions and purposes, after which, they were immediately disbanded. The bands were not paid for by the State, but by the officers of their particular regiments. Article 3 of the Royal Artillery Band's 'Articles of Agreement' of 1762 state that the [RA] musicians "will be looked upon as actual soldiers and cannot leave the regiment without a formal discharge." In 1783, we see the first mention of "three Foot Guards bands, each of 8 performers." Woolwich has been the home of the Artillery since the fifteenth century, as an important defence position guarding the port of London, and the Tower of London the original home of the Royal Arsenal, where everything associated with artillery and grenades was produced, before a new arsenal was built at Woolwich. Development &amp; Absolution. By November 1787, the Band (by now stationed at Woolwich) was under the command of its 'Master Musician' Friederich Wiele, also an outstanding violinist. Among the eight musicians, there now numbered five Englishmen, and all of the musicians were capable of performing on stringed, as well as on wind, instruments. In 1795 the bandmaster George McKenzie described the band as possessing fifteen musicians. The rank of 'Musician' was still peculiar to the Royal Artillery alone; the rank of 'Private' was usual in all other bands, with the term 'bandsmen' used instead of 'performers' or 'musicians'. (During the 'Options For Change' discussions between 1993 and 1996 it was finally decided to abolish the system of regimental bands of the line, and to retain only the staff and corps bands. Today, there are no 'bandsmen' in the British Army, as those remaining in service all hold the appointment 'Musician'). In 1802 the Band had recorded twenty one performers (the increase was probably owing to the absorption into its ranks of the Band of the Royal Irish Artillery, on its disbandment in 1801). The proficiency of the musicians led to the desirability of more bands to entertain the numerous artillery regiments of the day. King Louis 14th of France devised his own orchestra, the '24 Violinists of the King' based on the military orchestras of the day (in 1626) which infers that either those extant in Germany, or that of the still unofficial Royal Artillery Band were seen as models. Until the death of Queen Victoria, and for a great many years beyond, the standard of the Royal Artillery Orchestra remained unsurpassed in Britain. The Orchestra continued to be regularly engaged, by royal command, to play during and after state banquets at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Many first performances were given by the Orchestra, including, in 1868, the overture to 'Die Meistersinger von N rnberg' conducted by James Smyth. This piece would not be performed in this country by a civilian orchestra until the Philharmonic Orchestra of London included the work in a programme in 1882. For almost five years (1805 1810), the Band was under the charge of Colonel Charles A. Quist, the Commanding Officer, even though a Herr M. Eisenherdt had been appointed as Master Musician. Colonel Quist, who by 1810 had assumed the appointment of Band Commandant suggested the initiation of a series of vocal and orchestral concerts, known as the "Royal Artillery Concerts". These were held every week during the winters, at the RA Officers' Mess, and were conducted by some of the most distinguished musicians in London. While under the direction of George McKenzie, Master Musician (1810 1845), King William IV, having heard the Band play at the launching ceremony in 1883, of a ship in Woolwich, commanded the Band to play at the royal palace within the very same week (George McKenzie was appointed at the insistence of King George IV to Lord Bloomfield). King William wanted to present the Band with a pair of sterling silver kettledrums, but was disappointed when they were instead made of copper, enamelled, and "beautifully painted", so he also presented the officers with a superb candelabra. The inscription on the kettledrums reads "Presented by His Majesty King William IV., 1833)." In 1815 the Band of the Coldstream Guards had risen to twenty two 'bandsmen', while in 1812, it is also recorded that the Royal Artillery Band comprised thirty eight 'musicians'. By regulations, all bands, except that of the Royal Artillery which was not controlled by the War Office, were restricted to ten players and a bandmaster in 1821. In 1823, regulations permitted fourteen players, by which time, the Royal Artillery Band numbered thirty nine. At this time, the finest bands in the kingdom were the Royal Artillery Band under George Mackenzie, and the Court Military Band of George IV, directed by Christian Kramer. The nineteenth century was a period of experiment and refinement among the instruments of outdoor music. The most successful of these instruments were the saxophones (c. 1840), patented by Adolphe Sax, which although are regarded popularly as 'woodwind', are actually single reed brass instruments. The Royal Artillery Band were quick to adopt the alto and tenor members from the family of nine instruments, which became useful in supporting the clarinets. At the International Music Festival in Le Havre in 1925 the Royal Artillery Band won three first prizes, plus the coveted Conductor's Medal. Standardization of military bands, including instrumentation, sheet music, and drill, was an obvious requirement if different bands were to perform together. Carlo Boos , Bandmaster of the Scots Guards (himself German) recognized the need for uniformity of instrumentation. In 1845 he produced the first British publication of a military band arrangement, which was received with such great enthusiasm, that the firm Boosey &amp; Co. provided the funds to establish 'Boos 's Military Journal'. The number of musicians in the Royal Artillery Band had risen to over seventy by 1856, and by 1890, there were over a hundred performers. In 1856, the Duke of Cambridge proposed the acquisition of Kneller Hall, at Whitton, near Twickenham, for the permanent use of training Army musicians. Approval was received from all commanding officers, by way of a circular, on 4 December, and the first music class was scheduled to take place on 1 January 1857. The Royal Military School of Music was initially supported well by the majority of military bands, but with only four pupils to represent the Household Cavalry and Foot Guards. However, both the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers Bands continued to train their musicians exclusively at the Royal Artillery Junior Musicians Troop at Woolwich a practice that would continue until the 1980s, later also including musicians from the Band of the Royal Signals. (The Corps of the Royal Signals developed from the Royal Engineers Signals Unit, and was established in 1920). In 1894 there were a hundred and eighty eight bands in the British Army, and this rose to a hundred and ninety eight in 1926. It can be seen that for a small town to host this prestigious band was a big event, such as when Herne Bay invited the band to open its newly extended Central Bandstand in 1932. Over the next sixty seven years, the number of bands would decline. During the Second World War, the Royal Artillery Band was allotted a war station in Yorkshire, where it was responsible for tours in the Northern and Scottish Commands, and also completed a single tour of Northern Ireland. Towards the end of the war, the Band returned to London to serve the South Eastern Command, where it also provided a small detachment at Watford. There even existed a 'Royal Artillery Travelling Orchestra', which was conducted by the composer Robert Still, to support the main band, by allowing them to concentrate on their regimental and ceremonial engagements. The war years saw many associations between the Band and fellow Gunner celebrities, such as Max Jaffa, Eric Fenby, Harry Secombe, and Spike Milligan, as well as recordings and broadcasts with the Orchestra, for Vera Lynn, which it shared with the RAF Concert Orchestra, Mantovani and his orchestra, and Roland Shaw and his orchestra. After the war, the Band resumed its enviable position of being the band of choice for the most prestigious of national occasions. One of the most notable occasions took place on 30 November 1954, when the Royal Artillery Band gave a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in honour of their great admirer, Sir Winston Churchill, on his 80th birthday. At the height of Queen Victoria's reign, the number of band personnel in the Royal Artillery rose to over one hundred and fifty, including its 'symphony orchestra' of over eighty musicians. The massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery must therefore have been a truly formidable sight, particularly in the company of the Royal Artillery Mounted Band "The largest mounted band ever seen" (reprinted in 1984 in "The Times"), and the various other minor artillery bands that also existed. By the end of the so named 'British Empire', its size had reduced, but it continued to grow again, until, in 1977, the band comprised one hundred and twenty musicians, and on special occasions could be seen on parade with the regiment's massed bands the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (forty seven strong), and the (forty strong) Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band). In 1980, the Army Board had come to the conclusion that the Royal Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band would be required to adopt a wartime role. At that time, there were sixty eight bands in the Army, and apart from the Royal Artillery bands, all of them fulfilled the traditional wartime role as stretcher bearers. It was decided that in the case of the Royal Artillery bands, the musicians would be trained as drivers, and all three bands quickly ensured that their members were trained and qualified as HGV 2 drivers, with additional experience driving 10 tonne Monarch trucks during Operation Lionheart in 1982. Today's busy schedule includes regular public duties, such as the Changing of The Guard, and investitures at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, as the musicians continue to support Royal Artillery regiments throughout the country, appear at ambassadorial duties worldwide, and play at private engagements (necessary for providing an income towards instrument purchase and repairs, and new music scores and parts). Royal Artillery musicians have performed in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Africa, New Zealand, Hungary, China, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Slovenia, throughout Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries, and more recently in Russia for the 2011 Moscow Tattoo. The military band has also performed on a number of occasions at the Edinburgh Tattoo to a worldwide television audience. Presently, owing to the size of the Royal Artillery Band, it can no longer simultaneously provide an orchestra and marching band, however, the full orchestra continues to maintain symphonic capabilities. Until recently, and since 1993, the only other band capable of providing a full symphony orchestra was the Band of the Royal Engineers, at Chatham. Other ensembles currently provided by the Band include a concert band, a brass quintet, a string quartet and sextet, a jazz quartet, a woodwind quintet, and a contemporary Rock orchestra called 'Voice of the Guns'. The Orchestra appeared in 2011 as 'House Band' at the first revival of the Royal Tournament at Earls Court, London. The marching bands taking part were those of the Household Cavalry, the Royal Marines, and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force. Notably, the Orchestra has toured with various musical celebrities in the recent past, including Nigel Kennedy, Sir Harry Secombe, Anne Shelton, Moira Anderson, Carlos Bonnell, John Ogden, Stephen Isserlis, Hayley Westenra, David Russell, and Semprini, to name a few. There is evidence that the Royal Artillery Orchestra, or musicians from its ranks, are paving the way towards more involvement between military musicians and contemporary artists in a commercial capacity, including, so far, with Stanley Cornfield, and the Strawbs, with Rick Wakeman (Stanley Cornfield: "The Seawall" [CD]; "The Strawbs 40th Anniversary" Volume 2 [CD &amp; DVD]). This welcome trend is not however, completely unprecedented, as members of the Royal Artillery Band, and Royal Artillery Mounted Band, augmented the London Symphony Orchestra on their first 'classic rock' album on LP, in 1976. The original gatefold album sleeve includes a photograph of timpanist John Keel in ceremonial dress. The founder, director and conductor of the New Sousa Band, Keith Brion embarked on a series of recordings of the complete works of John Philip Sousa in 2000 on the Naxos label. The series is expected to reach sixteen volumes, and encompass marches, waltzes, operatic, and concert works, by the finest military bands and orchestras. Volumes 1 to 8 were recorded by the Royal Artillery Band, conducted by Keith Brion. In addition to the Royal Artillery Band ("Band of the Royal Regiment of Artillery"), there existed the Royal Artillery Band (Mounted Portion), the Royal Horse Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Woolwich), The Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Aldershot) [= later, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band], the Royal Garrison Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Band [= the Royal Artillery B.A.O.R Band = later, the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band], the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band. Of these, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band ("...the largest mounted band ever seen", according to The Times, in June 1984) existed as auxiliary bands, and minor staff bands, together with the Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich) until the Mounted Band was disbanded in 1984, and the Alanbrooke Band in 1993. These two bands had, for a number of years, alternately filled the "B.A.O.R." (British Army of the Rhine) post, at West Riding Barracks, Dortmund, until the withdrawal of the Regiment from there. The changeover occurred every five years, and the band returning to the United Kingdom, was likewise stationed for five years at Larkhill, Wiltshire. On occasion, these three bands would unite, as 'massed bands', of up to 197 performers, and more if the massed bands comprised these with the Territorial Army's Artillery bands, and the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company, such as on Horseguards Parade in Whitehall. The three regular bands also appeared on two separate years as massed bands at the Edinburgh Tattoo. On 9 February 2014, The Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich) paraded for the last time, on Gordon Square, Woolwich, in preparation for the move of the Royal Regiment of Artillery to its new headquarters at Larkhill, Wiltshire. However, the Band was relocated to Tidworth, close by. The now Royal Artillery (Tidworth) Band continued to serve in Tidworth through further cuts and changes to army music, which included a transformation from 'military band' (i.e. with woodwind, brass and percussion instruments) to a brass band, and eventual talk of the brass band being reduced further to a quintet. By early October 2019, it was announced by the Corps of Army Music (CAMus), that band would be relocated, along with two other bands, to form a new group of bands in Tidworth. Uniforms. The present uniform of the band was created for the massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery for the official birthday parade for Her Majesty the Queen, on Horse Guards Parade, in June 1986. The tunic replaced the No. 1 Dress Jacket, and was quilt lined. More elaborate gold braiding was added, with emphasis on rank of the wearer. Patent leather boots were worn by the 'other ranks' for the first time. As the famous Royal Artillery Mounted Band had been disbanded in 1984, the only other regular Army band to appear on that parade, was the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band (disbanded in 1993). From the Territorial Army, the Regimental Band of the Honourable Artillery Company and South Notts Hussars (RHA) Band contributed to the massed Artillery bands on that occasion. The Royal Artillery musicians' uniforms are based on the officers' pattern ceremonial uniforms of the past. From its uniform are derived (in some cases almost identically) the uniforms of the bands of the Royal Canadian Artillery, the Royal Australian Artillery, the Royal New Zealand Artillery, and the Royal Netherlands Army Artillery (indeed the latter even have their equivalent of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery). Slight differences are obviously evident between the nations, for example, the Royal Canadian Artillery Band wear white plumes, and do not wear spurs. The Royal Artillery Busby (based on the standard Hussars pattern head dress) was also adopted by the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Royal Corps Signals, from the Royal Engineers, came the unusual busby as worn by the Royal Air Force Music Service until 2011. Ceremonial dress. Head dress. RHA officers' pattern sealskin (formerly bearskin) busby (not to be confused with the bearskin cap, as worn by soldiers in the guards, and infantry), with tall white plume (ostrich feathers) attached to ferrule to the top of the front. Lanyard looped around cap. Red busby bag apparently, during the Napoleonic period, the bag could contain dried fruit (raisins) for sustenance when times were hard. It is also said that the other ranks' horse hair plumes were used in place of a shaving brush. Black leather chin strap faced with brass links. Only worn by King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery officers, and Royal Artillery directors of music. Tunic. RA officers' pattern ceremonial tunic (worn only by Directors of Music) in navy blue felt, quilt lined. Standing collar, fastened with hooks, and cuffs in scarlet felt, with scarlet piping to front button hole edge. Ornate edging, and 'Austrian knots' in 18K gold twine braide. RA officers' pattern bomb badges sewn onto collar. Gold epaulettes. Worn on the right arm is the unique Royal Artillery musician pattern lyre, in 18K gold wire on a black felt background. All other musicians in the British Army wear the standard bandsman pattern lyre, with the exception of musicians from The Household Division who do not wear a lyre on their uniforms. Accessories. Leather, covered with 18K gold panel and braiding, attached to which is an RA officers' pattern embroidered pouch at rear. In matching pattern to the crossbelt (above). Navy blue cavalry pattern tight fitting cavalry style pantaloons, with wide RA stripe in scarlet felt sewn onto outside of each leg. Leather straps with buckles are attached to the bottoms of the legs, which fasten under the arch of the boots. Cavalry officers' pattern George boots in black patent leather, with box fittings in heels, for detachable silver spurs. Boots are secured by leather straps attached to hose. Other ranks. Ceremonial dress. Other Ranks: RA sealskin [sable] busby (often artificial nowadays), with six inch scarlet plume (horse hair) slotted into brass plume holder, in the form of a grenade, with the old pattern RFA cap badge depicted on the 'bomb'. The plume (formerly scarlet cut feathers) is held closed by a brass ring (a thicker ring is used on the Drum Major's headdress). No lanyard attached to cap. Red busby bag (as above). Black leather chin strap, faced with brass links. A similar busby is worn by the musicians of the Royal Engineers, and Royal Signals bands, with busby bags in their own Corps' colours, with the plume mounted in a similar plume holder to the side of the cap. The Bandmaster's busby is similar to that worn by the Director of Music, but the white plume is smaller. At various times during the Band's history, other forms of head dress were worn, according to fashion. These included the bearskin cap (similar to that worn by Guardsmen), the shako, and the pith helmet (identical in shape to the Victorian police helmet). Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the RA No. 1 Dress peaked cap was worn as the sole form of ceremonial head dress. Unlike in all other bands, the Royal Artillery Band has always included a bandmaster as assistant to the Director of Music. Since the reorganization of bands, and the foundation of the Corps of Army Music, a bandmaster has been appointed to each band in the standard roll of Training Officer / Musician. Bandsman pattern navy blue felt tunic, quilt lined. Standing collar, fastened with hooks, and cuffs in scarlet felt, with scarlet piping to front button hole edge. Ornate edging (with emphasis on rank held reflected in gauge), and 'Austrian knots' in 18K gold twine braide (with emphasis on rank held reflected in gauge). Other ranks' pattern RA bomb badges (gold twine) sewn onto collar. Worn on the right arm is the unique RA Musician lyre badge, in 18K gold twine on black felt (all other British army musicians wear the standard Army bandsman pattern lyre badge). Accessories. Leather, covered with 18K gold panel and braiding, attached to which is a cavalry standard pattern pouch at rear, onto which is mounted a brass RA gun badge. Depending on the instrument played, a crossbelt may cause damage to the instrument, or be restrictive to movement. Therefore, not all musicians wear a crossbelt. Similarly, certain musicians will be seen to wear a protective bib, or apron, normally in a complementary colour to their individual band uniform. The purpose of the crossbelt pouch was so that an officer or senior rank could post an important message into the courier's pouch, by unhooking the leather tab, inserting the note, then securing the flap, in the briefest possible time. The courier would then ride off at speed to deliver it. In some bands a tradition still held by the bands of the footguards, larger pouches were used to store march cards (cards measuring approximately 180 mm 130 mm on which the individual instrumental sheet music parts are pasted). The march cards are held, to enable the player to read his part, in a heavy duty clip (known as a 'lyre') which is attached to his instrument. At the back of the lyre, but facing forward, is placed the 'backing card', to hide the music from the view of the public. The backing card normally shows the 'cap badge' of the regiment or corps. In matching pattern to the crossbelt (above). A unique pattern short sword hooked onto the swordbelt. The hook protrudes through the tunic, allowing the sword to hang visibly. Only worn by the Royal Artillery Band. The sword has never been worn by other Royal Artillery bands. The Bandmaster, Drum Major, and Band Sergeant Major carry the standard British Army sword, as worn by warrant officers. Navy blue cavalry pattern tight fitting cavalry style pantaloons, with wide RA stripe in scarlet felt sewn onto outside of each leg. Leather straps with buckles are attached to the bottoms of the legs, which fasten under the arch of the boots. Cavalry pattern George boots in black leather (nowadays patent leather), with silver spurs screwed into the heels of boots. Boots are secured by leather straps attached to hose. Drum major. The drum major, as the figurehead, and leader of the marching band, historically always wore a more flamboyant uniform to emphasize his special status. Today, in the Royal Artillery, this is shown by the amount of gold braid and facings on his uniform, an elaborately decorated crossbelt, and a heavier plume ring, holding closed a taller scarlet cut feather plume. He carries a mace, which is used to signal his commands to the musicians, in conjunction with vocal commands as required. The signals are closely observed by the bass drummer, who then administers a drum signal which is audible to every musician. This is necessary, because the musicians must concentrate on reading from their [sheet music] parts. There was a period when the RA Drum Majors wore, contrary to the rest of the Band, a tall bearskin cap (similar to that worn by the Guards regiments), with a plume rising up one side of the cap, and draped round the crown, and down the other side. Following the Drum Major's command a mace signal indicates to the drummers (bass and side drums) when to commence the drum rolls. In the tradition of most regiments, Royal Artillery troops step off after two sets of three pace drum rolls are sounded, in quick march time. Guards regiments traditionally step off after one set of five pace rolls. When the Royal Artillery Band appears on parade at the same time as troops and bands from the Guards and other regiments, a seven pace drum roll is sometimes used to differentiate between themselves, and all other bands, with the Royal Artillery taking precedence. With the exception of the Guards' five pace roll, which equals six beats, all other combinations of rolls consist of eight beats (or two bars in quadruple time). Master Musicians, Band Masters, Directors of Music (1762 1994). In 1994 the Royal Artillery Band and Orchestra were absorbed in the new Corps of Army Music, which meant that, as with all the bands in the Corps, its musicians could be borrowed by other bands, or be posted to other bands as the need arose. Likewise, musicians from other bands could find themselves playing in the Royal Artillery Band. Effectively, this spelt the end of individuality of sound of all bands, and for this reason, only directors of music, and bandmasters from the original Royal Artillery Band are below. "1810 1845:" George McKenzie, Master of the Band "(a former orchestra leader, Mackenzie was devoted to the development and success of the Orchestra)" "1845 1865:" William George Collins, Master of the Band "(a corporal in the Royal Artillery Band)" "1865 1881:" James Smyth, Band Master "(pronounced 'Smith'. Smyth conducted the premiere British performance of the overture to 'The Master Singers of Nuremberg' by Wagner in 1868)" Smyth possibly felt that the style 'Master of the Band' was old fashioned, and could have been influential in effecting its change to 'Band Master. "1881:" "An interregnum under Albert Mansfield, Acting Bandmaster" following a directive to appoint an established conductor of outstanding reputation "1881 1907:" Cavaliere Ladislao Joseph Phillip Paul Zavertal, Bandmaster "(Zavertal introduced the 'New World Symphony' by Dvorak, and Smetana's overtures and incidental music to 'The Bartered Bride' and 'Vitava' to British audiences, and raised the standard of the Orchestra to an unprecedented high level, leading to frequent royal command performances by Queen Victoria, whose mother, the Duchess of Kent, composed the majestic 'Royal Artillery Slow March'). Zavertal received the following honours: the Jubillee Medal; the Royal Victorian Order; Cavaliere of the Crown of Italy; Order of the Redeemer (from the King of Greece); Knight Commander Royal Order of Takoya (Serbia), the Commander's Star of the Osmanieh (from the Sultan of Turkey), Society of St. Cecilia of Rome (elected member) and the Saxe Coburg Ernestine Order of Art and Science" "A conductor of international fame. Prior to his appointment, the Duke of Cambridge, 'Commanding in Chief' had issued a Horse Guards letter to every commanding officer praising Kneller Hall's work in producing British bandmaster for the Army: "I am gratified at finding that the system of training regimental musicians for promotion to the situation of Bandmaster to the exclusion of civilians and foreigners has worked so well..." The appointment of Zavertal was in fact permitted by the Duke of Cambridge, who was not actually 'Commanding in Chief', but rather 'Colonel in Chief'. For the first time, we see the term 'Bandmaster' applied to the Master of the Band, which is similar to the current appointment in appearance only. Today, 'bandmaster' is an auxiliary position, held by a Warrant Officer, Class 1". "1907 1936:" Major Edward C. Stretton, Director of Music "Appointed for the "continued prestige he will bring the Band" (under Cavaliere (Sir) Zavertal's command, the Orchestra became internationally known, and little emphasis was given to maintaining the standard of the Wind Band. Zavertal was not himself, keen to appear on parades, and was happy to leave this side of the organization to the command of his SNCOs. In 1918, Stretton was awarded the MVO, by King George V". "1936 1955:" Lieutenant Colonel Owen W. Geary, Director of Music "1955 1966:" Major Sidney Victor Hays, Director of Music "The recordings made by the band under the directorship of Major Hays are among the most sought after by collectors of military band music worldwide". "Under Colonel Patch's baton, the Band excelled at light music in particular, and his authoritative knowledge of the music and life of the Strauss family was popularly regarded". "1985 1988:" Lieutenant Colonel Frank Anthony Renton "Colonel Renton later became Principal Director of Music, British Army. An ex director of music, of both the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band (the only director of music to hold the distinction of having served in all three bands of the Royal Regiment), who is widely regarded as one of the finest conductors to have served in the British Army." "1988 1992:" Major Clarence Roberts Collier Garrity "Ex Director of Music, the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band. A consummate composer, arranger, and dance band performer (saxophone &amp; keyboard)". "1992 1996:" Major Terence Sean Davis "The final director of music to command the band before its absorption into the Corps of Army Music (CAMus) in 1994". The 'Bandmaster' in today's British military band is the 'Assistant Conductor' to the Director of Music, and represents him in his absence. Among the performers of the band are the instrumental section leaders, whose job it is, to ensure a cohesive style of playing within their own sections, and where applicable, to be able to play solos. In an orchestra, there is the addition of the Leader (Principal First Violin), who on occasion must be able to direct the orchestra (from the violin), or conduct. An unusual aspect of military bands is that, by necessity, a leader or section leader is selected for being the best exponent on his chosen instrument. The situation arises therefore, on a day to day basis, that an ensemble, band, or orchestra, must perform under the command of a musician of any rank, notwithstanding the fact that there may be senior ranking musicians playing within the sections. The musician in charge is also completely responsible in rehearsal. Such a situation is often difficult to comprehend or accept, even from fellow servicemen. However, it should be remembered, that the musician in charge is representing the Director of Music. Senior ranking members of the band, although in this case under the command of the lower rank, nevertheless remain at all times in control, in such areas as attitude, discipline, and presentation, leaving artistic control, and interpretation firmly in the hands of the leading musician. Formation of The Corps of Army Music (1994). On 13 August 1994 the Queen signed a warrant to allow the formation of the Corps of Army Music. It was her will and pleasure that all officers who were directors of music in the various corps and regiments, and all army musicians should transfer to the Corps of Army Music. The transfer took place on 1 September 1994. From that time, all bands were accorded a director of music, and a bandmaster. The latter's role being concomitant with that of Training Officer. The 'Private' rank of 'Bandsman' was abolished, in favour of 'Musician' of the former staff bands. Individual bands continue to wear the uniforms and cap badges of the regiments and corps which they support, but their personnel all belong to the same corps. The Royal Artillery Band does not take a direct role in the Trooping the Colour parade. The Trooping the Colour as seen on Horse Guards Parade is a ceremony, which involves the whole of the Household Division, the Household Cavalry, and nowadays, also the King's Troop (as head of Her Majesty's Household Troops). While other regiments and corps hold similar trooping the colour ceremonies, that of the Guards is held annually to celebrate the official birthday of Her Majesty the Queen. The Royal Artillery Band is nevertheless always very much in evidence on the day of the Trooping the Colour, by taking part in the Royal Birthday gun salute given by the King's Troop in Hyde Park. The total number of bands remaining after 'Options for Change' was 29. By 2013, there were 23. State bands. The Royal Artillery Band is the oldest band in the British Army, but was the last regular army band to be accorded 'state band' status, a status which it lost on 9 February 2014 when both the Royal Regiment and its band vacated Woolwich Barracks. However, the Band had held the status of a state band twice before, during the reigns of King George II/King George III, and Queen Victoria. Notwithstanding, the Royal Artillery Band was often in demand for important state and public duties, and to represent the nation. It was the favourite band of King George IV, the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother), Queen Victoria, and Sir Winston Churchill. The number of Regular Army State Bands, was further reduced on 1 September 2014, when The Band of the Life Guards and The Band of The Blues and Royals were joined to form The Band of The Household Cavalry. At the same time the Army Reserve (United Kingdom) Bands of the Honourable Artillery Company and the Royal Yeomanry were both granted State Band status. Satellite and Depot Bands. In addition to the Royal Artillery Band, the regiment maintained a number of official 'satellite' professional bands, and 'depot' professional bands, to support Royal Artillery units elsewhere. These were, SATELLITE: Royal Horse Artillery Band (1993 1877); Royal Artillery Brass Band (1869 1893); Royal Artillery Mounted Band* (1886 1985); Royal Artillery Portsmouth Band** (1903 1953); Royal Artillery BAOR Band** (1953 1993); Royal Artillery Larkhill Band** (1967 1971); Royal Artillery Plymouth Band (1903 1921); Royal Artillery Salisbury Plain Band** (1921 1946); Royal Artillery Plymouth Band (1947 1952); Royal Artillery Northern Command Band (1952 1953); Royal Artillery Plymouth Band (1953 1961); Royal Artillery Gibraltar Band (1899 1928); Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band** (1972 1993); Royal Artillery Malta Band (1885 1970), DEPOT: Royal Artillery Warley Band (dates unknown); Royal Artillery Sheerness Band (dates unknown); Royal Artillery Dover Band (dates unknown); Royal Artillery Canterbury Band (dates unknown). Regimental music. British Grenadiers March. The tune 'The British Grenadiers' was first adopted for use as a regimental march by the Honourable Artillery Company (the oldest British regiment), during the English Civil War. Although grenades were first launched by artillerymen in 1643, the term 'grenade' was only first documented in 1688. Originally a Dutch song, the melody now known as 'The British Grenadiers' was brought to England by King William III of the Netherlands. Soon after the melody became popular in these islands, a version of it, titled 'The New Bath' appeared in a '17th Century Dance Book' by Playford. In the Netherlands, it is known as 'De jonge prins van Friesland' ('The Young Friesian Prince') after Prince Johann Willem Friso. In 1716, the march became the regimental quick march of the Royal Artillery, and was known as the 'Royal Artillery Grenadiers March', but was not declared 'official' until 1882. It first appeared in print, as 'The British Grenadiers' in 1740. During the War of Spanish Succession (1702 1713) a text was added, which remains to this day in publications of the tune as a British folk song. The 'British Grenadiers' later became the regimental march of both the Grenadier Guards, and the Royal Fusiliers (the Grenadier Guards were formed after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815). Notwithstanding the formation of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) in 1685, the Grenade (a small incendiary device originating during the Eastern Roman 'Byzantine' Empire) is a weapon of artillery, and as such was always manufactured and kept in the royal arsenals of King Henry VIII at the Tower of London, and at Chatham, and Woolwich both in the county of Kent, until the Fusilier regiments, and later the Foot Guards, each adopted them as standard weaponry. Therefore, the original grenadiers, were in fact artillerymen. As a regimental quick march, the short duration of the melody has always resulted in unwanted repetition, but in 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Patch (then Director of Music) provided a suitable solution, by adding the "Trio" section of another favourite artillery march, 'The Voice of The Guns', composed by Major F.J. Ricketts under the pseudonym 'Kenneth J. Alford'. The popularity of the tune 'The British Grenadiers' during the Napoleonic Wars rivalled that of its contemporary 'Lilliburlero', and subsequently led to its adoption by all regiments who wear as their cap or collar badges, the symbol of the grenade. The Trayne of Artillery's Grenadiers March. Prior to the Royal Artillery adopting 'The British Grenadiers' in 1716 as its regimental quick march, 'The Train of Artillery' (as it is now known) was the rather elegant (medium ) original quick march of the royal regiment. The march later appeared in print for the first time, published by Thompson &amp; Son, London, in 'The Compleat Tutor for the Fife', circa 1760. The first "grenadiers", or grenade throwers were artillery soldiers. The original military march is scored for eight players, comprising 2 piccolos (in two part counterpoint), 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, and 2 drums. At the time, the two piccolos were played by the two clarinetists of the band, who alternated between clarinet and piccolo as required. Two updated recordings exist by the Royal Artillery one conducted by its director of music Major Robert Quinn (in 18th century style, albeit for full modern military band), and a contemporary version, arranged and conducted by Lt Colonel Malcom Torrent. The Minden Rose. The origins of this march are obscure. The piece was first documented as 'Mindener Marsch', and possibly came into being during the battle of Minden. In style, it is a ceremonial 'Reiter Marsch', or cavalry march, and probably adapted to accompany the horse drawn guns of the Artillery, from a German regional folk song. The Marquess of Granby's March. The Marquess of Granby (the Earl of Rutland) was Master General of the Regiment (1763 1772), and was preceded by General Ligonier (1759 1763) after whom, a now forgotten slow march 'General Ligonier's March' was named. The appointment 'Master General' is nowadays known as 'Master Gunner, St. James's Park' (not to be confused with 'Master Gunner', which is a Warrant Officer special skills appointment). The Royal Artillery Slow March. The Royal Artillery Slow March was composed by Princess Louisa Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and mother of Queen Victoria (herself "a most competent musician"), circa 1836, and first used in 1843. It is also the regimental walk march of the Royal Horse Artillery, and is also used (but in a different version) by the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Until 1843, when the first 'regimental marches' were officially chosen (at the suggestion of George Mackenzie, Master of the Royal Artillery Band), regiments became accustomed to those marches that were played regularly for representation and recognition purposes, which had usually been composed by the current masters of their bands. With each change of master, marches lapsed into disuse, to be replaced by newer ones. Regimental Trot 'The Keel Row'. The Royal Horse Artillery (and cavalry regiments) adopted this Tyneside air in 1903 on its publication by the War Office. This march is one example of the Regiment's intention to cater for all of its troops, drawn, as they were, from all regions of the United Kingdom. By comparison, almost all other regiments have traditionally recruited locally (e.g. the Devon &amp; Dorset Regiment, the Durham Light Infantry, the Royal Hampshire Regiment, the Green Howards, etc.). Regimental Canter 'Bonnie Dundee'. The melody of 'Bonnie Dundee' dates back to the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. By 1600 the melody was certainly known all over Scotland and England. It appears in 'The Beggar's Opera' and was used by Robert Burns. It is also associated with a poem by Sir Walter Scott, which commemorates the Viscount of Dundee's bravery in the 1689 rebellion. It is believed that the title of this melody refers to the Viscount of Dundee, rather than to the jute , and marmalade producing city of the same name. Fanfare 'The Royal Regiment'. The composer Frederic Curzon (1899, London 1973, Bournemouth) was at one time, a Gunner officer. Curzon wrote this fanfare for the opening of the Royal Artillery Association Rally in 1952. Its masterful use of both the RA's and RHA's 'Trumpet Call' typify the composer's penchant for incorporating melodies that he associated with his personal experiences in life. Of his many lasting compositions, perhaps the most perennial are the suites "Robin Hood", "In Malaga", "Dance of an Ostracized Imp", "Galavant", and "The Boulevardier", all of which continue to be performed, and recorded by orchestras worldwide. Frederic Curzon frequently performed as an unofficial band member at the Royal Artillery Officers Mess in Woolwich, playing violin, cello, piano, and organ. He was an honorary member of the Royal Artillery Band. Other notable composers who wrote specially for the Royal Artillery Band include Zavertal, Dvo k, C P E Bach, and Sir Arthur Bliss, Master of the Queen's Music. The 'Eton Boating Song'. The 'Eton Boating Song' was composed in 1863 by one Captain Algernon Drummond, and transcribed by T. L. Mitchell, and the piano accompaniment was arranged by Evelyn Wodehouse. The words of Kipling's 'Screw Guns' from his 'Barrack Room Ballads' are well known to RA officers and soldiers. Screw guns were so named, because the barrels could be broken down into pieces, to be carried on mules in mountainous regions. They were last used during the Second World War, by RA Mountain Regiments in the campaign in Italy. The piece was arranged for orchestra, with a transcribed edition for military band, by Karl Kaps, as an 'English' (='slow', with 3 definite beats to the bar) waltz, and published by B. Feldman &amp; Co. London. First performances &amp; Cinema.

Terence Smith (born in 1953, London, England) is the founder and chief executive of Fundsmith and a notable British fund manager. He was formerly the chief executive of Tullett Prebon and Collins Stewart. He is a bestselling author and a regular media commentator on investment issues. He has been referred to as "the English Warren Buffett" for his style of growth investing, which involves buying and holding shares in a relatively small number of established companies. Smith was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2012, after his work in recognising the contribution of Sir Keith Park during the Battle of Britain. In 2016, Smith received an Honorary Fellowship from Cardiff University. The Sunday Times Rich List has estimated his wealth to be 300 million. Early life. Smith grew up in East London where he attended Stratford Grammar School before reading history at University College Cardiff in 1974, graduating with a First. He turned down an offer of research fellowship to pursue a career in business. Early career. Smith worked for Barclays Bank from 1973 to 1984. He managed the Pall Mall branch before transferring to the firm's finance department, where he developed an interest in stock analysis. He obtained an MBA from Henley Management College in 1979. He left Barclays to work at W Greenwell &amp; Co as a research analyst. Later he joined Barclays de Zoete Wedd. In 1990 he was appointed Head of UK Company Research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a position from which he was dismissed in 1992 following the publication of his best selling book "Accounting for Growth". Accounting for Growth. In 1990 a series of high profile FTSE 100 public companies went bust, including Polly Peck and British and Commonwealth. Smith's clients wanted to know why these firms had failed despite posting apparently healthy profits. In response, Smith wrote an analysts circular showing that these firms had run into difficulties with cash flow, rather than profitability, and in some cases had used deliberately misleading accounting techniques. Smith's paper examined 12 of these techniques; the paper's title, "Accounting for Growth", was intended as a pun. The paper was well received and led to a book publishing contract with Random House. UBS asked Smith to withdraw the book. Both Smith and Random House refused. UBS suspended Smith before firing and suing him. Smith counter sued; the two parties settled out of court 18 months later. The controversy helped propel the book to the top of the bestsellers chart, displacing Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time from the no.1 spot and eventually selling over 100,000 copies. Collins Stewart and Tullett Prebon. Smith joined Collins Stewart in 1992, shortly after being fired from UBS. He became a director in 1996; in 2000 he became Chief Executive after leading a management buy out. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in the same year.

Smith is a noted critic of the established fee structure of investment management firms, claiming that most managers churn their stocks too many times, and that retail investors often lose the bulk of gains to excessive management fees and expenses. In 2014 he said: "Last year we spent 98,000 on dealing on a 3.5 billion fund, meaning total dealing costs were 0.005%. The FCA statistics suggest the average fund manager in the UK spends 1 1.5% on dealing. It's a big drag on performance. Writing in the Financial Times, Smith has used a Tour de France analogy to explain his long term investment philosophy. He states that it is pointless to search for a fund manager who can perform well in all market conditions, likening them to cyclists in the Tour, which has never been won by a rider who won every stage, and it never will. Like the Tour, investment is a test of endurance, and the winner will be the investor who finds a good strategy or fund and sticks with it. Other interests.

Since the lateral shrines have no tower over them and are directly connected to the hall without a vestibule and its corresponding tower like projection, they do not appear like shrines from the outside. Rather, they are absorbed into the walls of hall. The central shrine on the contrary is highly visible because of its tower and the "sukhanasi" that projects prominently from the tower. The cella in the central shrine has a "linga" (the universal symbol of the god Shiva) while the lateral shrines contain an image of "surya" (the sun) and a pair of "nagas" (snakes). The temple stands on a platform called "jagati", a feature common to many Hoysala temples. The platform, in addition to its visual appeal, is meant to provide devotees a path for circumambulation ("pradakshinapatha") around the temple. It closely follows the outline of the temple, giving it a good elevated look. It has two flights of steps leading to each lateral entrance of the temple. The tower over the central shrine and the vestibule ("sukhanasi" or nose) are intact and highly decorative. The other standard features of a Hoysala temple; the large domed roof over the tower (called "helmet" or "amalaka"), the "kalasa" on top of it (the decorative water pot at the apex of the helmet) and the Hoysala crest (emblem of the Hoysala warrior stabbing a lion) over the "sukhanasi" are all intact, adding to the decorative look. The dome is actually a heavy, well sculptured "helmet" over the tower and is the largest piece of sculpture in the temple (2x2 meters). Its shape usually follows that of the shrine and hence can be either square or star shaped. Decoration and sculptures. The decorative plan of the walls of the shrines and the "mantapa" (hall) is of the "new kind", with two eaves that run around the temple. The wall panel images have the same quality of workmanship seen in the more famous temples at Belur and Halebidu, though the images are smaller and simpler. In the "new kind" of decorative articulation, the first heavy eaves runs below the superstructure and all around the temple with a projection of about half a meter. The second eaves runs around the temple about a meter below the first. Between the two eaves are the miniature decorative towers (Aedicula) on pilasters. Below the second eaves are the wall panel of images of Hindu deities and their attendants in relief. Below this, at the base are the six equal width rectangular moldings (frieze). Starting from the top, the friezes depict "hansa" (birds) in the first frieze, "makara" (aquatic monsters) in the second (though often interrupted with "kirtimukhas" in this temple), epics and other stories in the third (which in this case is from the Hindu epic Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and stories of Krishna), lions in the fourth (instead of the more commonly seen leafy scrolls), horses in the fifth and elephants at the bottom. At the entrance to the hall are elephant balustrades. Notable among the wall panel sculptures and depicting scenes from the epics and puranic stories are the 16 handed Shiva dancing on the head of a demon called Andhakasura, dancing images of a 22 armed Durga and Saraswati, King Ravana lifting Mount Kailash, the Pandava prince Arjuna shooting the fish target, and Draupadi rushing forth with garland, and the slaying of the demon Gajasura.

A current conveyor is an abstraction for a three terminal analogue electronic device. It is a form of electronic amplifier with unity gain. There are three versions of generations of the idealised device, CCI, CCII and CCIII. When configured with other circuit elements, real current conveyors can perform many analogue signal processing functions, in a similar manner to the way op amps and the ideal concept of the op amp are used. History. When Sedra and Smith first introduced the current conveyor in 1968, it was not clear what the benefits of the concept would be. The idea of the op amp had been well known since the 1940s and integrated circuit manufacturers were better able to capitalise on this widespread knowledge within the electronics industry. Monolithic current conveyor implementations were not introduced and the op amp became widely implemented. Since the early 2000s, implementations of the current conveyor concept, especially within larger VLSI projects such as mobile phones, have proved worthwhile. Advantages. Current conveyors can provide better gain bandwidth products than comparable op amps, under both small and large signal conditions. In instrumentation amplifiers, their gain does not depend on the matching of pairs of external components, only on the absolute value of a single circuit element. First generation (CCI). The CCI is a three terminal device with the terminals designated "X", "Y", and "Z". The potential at "X" equals whatever voltage is applied to "Y". Whatever current flows into "Y" also flows into "X", and is mirrored at "Z" with a high output impedance, as a variable constant current source. In sub type CCI+, current into "Y" produces current into "Z"; in a CCI , current into "Y" results in an equivalent current flowing "out" of "Z". Second generation (CCII). In a more versatile later design, no current flows through terminal "Y". The ideal CCII can be seen as an ideal transistor, with perfected characteristics. No current flows into the gate or base which is represented by "Y". There is no base emitter or gate source voltage drop, so the emitter or source voltage (at "X") follows the voltage at "Y". The gate or base has an infinite input impedance ("Y"), while the emitter or source has a zero input impedance ("X"). Any current out of the emitter or source ("X") is reflected at the collector or drain ("Z") as a current in, but with an infinite output impedance. Because of this reversal of sense between "X" and "Z" currents, this ideal bipolar or field effect transistor represents a CCII . If current flowing out of "X" resulted in the same high impedance current flowing "out" of "Z", it would be a CCII+. Third generation (CCIII). The third configuration of the current conveyor is similar to the CCI except that the current in "X" is reversed, so in a CCIII whatever current flows into "Y" also flows out of "X".

The Provisional Siberian Government was a short lived government in Siberia created by the White movement in 1918. History. At the beginning of 1918, a Provisional Siberian Government (PSG) was established in the eastern coastal city of Vladivostok. Most of the members of this first Siberian provisional government were members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR), including the head of this government, Pyotr Derber. In June 1918, Bolshevik forces in central Siberia were overthrown by the Czechoslovak Legions and Monarchist Russian officers organizations. The ultra conservative and nationalist Russian officers considered the Socialist Revolutionary Party to be virtually identical to the hated Bolsheviks and thus sought to install a new regime closer to their own political orientation. On 30 June 1918, a meeting was convened to establish such a new regime. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of this new government was Pyotr Vologodsky. The Derber government in Vladivostok refused to recognize the legitimacy of this new government based in Omsk. A reorganization of the Vladivostok government followed, with the name Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia (PGAS) adopted. The PGAS in Vladivostok and new PSG in Omsk refused to recognize the other, and each claimed for themselves the mantle as the sole government of Siberia. The generals of the Siberian Army placed their allegiance with the Vologodskii government in Omsk, however, leading to the marginalization of the Vladivostok regime. In September 1918 the Provisional Siberian Government became a part of Provisional All Russian Government. In November 1918 a coup took place in Omsk called the Kolchak coup d'etat and installed Alexander Kolchak as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.

Salvatore Pelle (; born December 4, 1957 in San Luca), also known as ("Salvo Bad Leg") is an Italian criminal and a member of the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia type organisation in Calabria. He was born in San Luca in Calabria and is the eldest of the four sons of Antonio Pelle, also known as "Ntoni Gambazza", the head of the 'Ndrangheta "locale" of San Luca and the "capo crimine", the ceremonial head of the 'Ndrangheta. He was a fugitive since 1991 and included on the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy for international drug trafficking and mafia association, until his arrest on March 10, 2007, in Reggio Calabria. He was sentenced to 11 years for international drug trafficking. While on the run he only used trains and buses, and did not own a mobile phone to avoid being detected. In the 1990s, he was involved in importing tonnes hashish for the Pelle and Romeo clans in San Luca from Lebanon with Georges Semaan, a Lebanese arms and drug trafficker. Loads were delivered in Apulia and Calabria, with the help of the Sacra Corona Unita and Giuseppe Morabito, the 'Ndrangheta boss from Africo, and Salvatore Pisano. After the death of his father in November 2009, he became the nominal head of the clan. His younger brother Giuseppe Pelle actively tried to get Salvatore transferred from the Rebibbia prison in Rome to one close to his hometown. Prior to the regional elections of March 2010 politicians visited the house of Giuseppe Pelle offering favourable treatment for Salvatore and public works contracts if his brother would deliver votes, which he did. However, before the ploy could work, Giuseppe Pelle and politicians and doctors involved were arrested.

As of 2015, the league systems spans up to 14 levels and consists of over 2,300 divisions in total, that stands at the end of a development starting around the year 1900 with different district leagues, was then organized over decades on a regional basis and saw the first edition of a nationwide league as late as 1963. Until 1933. Until the foundation of the German Football Association there had already been different regional and district championships' respective leagues and it was not until 1906 that there was a consistent mode to determine the participants of the German championship that was played as a final tournament until the foundation of the Bundesliga. For that reason football in Germany was divided into seven regions which had their own regional championships (that were mostly played as a cup tournament, too). Only the regional champions and the defending German champion were qualified to play in the championship until 1924, when the number of final tournament participants was increased to 16. As there were no regional top level league established the system of many parallel leagues and divisions continued up to the 1933 34 season. From the late 1920s on there were efforts to install a nationwide professional league, but these efforts were never powerful enough to outreach the strong anti professionalism from conservative and nationalist officials. 1933 1944. National Socialism took power in Germany in January 1933. This also meant the end of attempts to invent professional football in Germany. But the football authorities did restructure and slightly centralise the football competition system. So in 1933 the Gauliga (county league) system was initiated as a system of 16 top level divisions similar in strength that replaced the more than thirty previous top level divisions. The champion of each Gauliga was qualified to play in the German championship tournament. With 10 teams each in the Gau leagues, the number of teams in the top flight was 160, a reduction from 400 to 500 teams until then. The number of Gau leagues increased to 31 in 1944, because of league division for economic reasons (transport costs) and territory annexion during World War II. 1947 1963. After World War II the Oberliga system developed out of the occupation zone championships. The best teams of the five West German top level divisions qualified for the German championship tournament. From 1949 until 1991 the German Democratic Republic had its own football league system. 1963 1974. Since the late 1920s there had been plans to establish a nationwide professional top level league, but they all failed because of the opposition by anti professionalists and the relatively strong regional football associations. In summer 1962, under the influence of the FIFA World Cup quarter final defeat to Yugoslavia, the German Football Association decided to establish the Bundesliga as a nationwide professional football league. The previous Oberliga became the second level of the German league system, now named Regionalliga. Its five parallel divisions (Nord, West, S dwest, S d, Stadtliga Berlin) corresponded with the previous Oberliga divisions. In the first two years the Bundesliga had 16 members but their number was increased to 18 in 1965. Two teams were relegated to the Regionalliga. The first two teams from each Regionalliga division and the champion of West Berlin competed in a promotion tournament in two groups, whose winners were promoted into the Bundesliga. 1974 1981. Soon it became obvious that the financial gap between the fully professionalised Bundesliga and the five Regionalliga divisions, where many semi professional and even amateur like clubs competed, was too large. Teams relegated from the Bundesliga were often in serious danger of bankruptcy. Some clubs tried to avoid this fate by match fixing, known as the 1971 Bundesliga scandal. To narrow the gap between pro football and amateur levels, in 1974 a second professional tier was introduced with the 2. Bundesliga, having a North and a South Division with usually 20 clubs each. For the first time in Bundesliga history, the level II division champions gained direct access to the Bundesliga, as the former promotion tournament was disestablished. Instead, even the playoff winner among the two runners up was also promoted, with relegation from the Bundesliga therefore increased to 3 clubs. As the Regionalligas were dissolved in 1974, with about one half of the former Regionalliga clubs relegated to their corresponding fully amateur state league pyramids, between 1974 and 1978, several amateur premier leagues, called Amateur Oberliga, were established in every region, to narrow the gap between professional football and amateur level once more. 1981 1991. In 1981 the two divisions of the 2nd Bundesliga were merged into one nationwide division with 20 teams. 1991 1994. As the league systems of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were merged in 1991, the number of teams competing in the Bundesliga was temporarily increased to 20 and to make room for 24 teams the 2. Bundesliga was again divided into a North and a South division of 12 teams each. In 1992 the number of competing teams in the Bundesliga was re decreased to 18 with four teams relegated and only two promoted from the second level. The 2. Bundesliga played one more season with 24 teams in one division before its size was decreased to 20 members in 1993 and 18 teams in 1994. 1994 2000. In 1994 the Regionalliga was re established at the third tier of the German football league system. It was divided into four divisions (Nord, Nordost, West/S dwest and S d). Four teams were promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. At the beginning these were the four division champions, but later the champions of the Nord and Nordost division had to compete in a promotion play off while one runner up from the South or West division was promoted additionally. 2000 2008. From 2000 until 2008 there were two Regionalliga divisions (Nord and S d), the champions and runners up of each division were promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. 2008 2012. In 2006, the German Football Association decided to establish a further nationwide league at the third level of the German football league system starting with the 2008 09 season. This 3. Liga consists of 20 teams. In the starting season the league consisted of the four lowest ranked teams of the 2. Bundesliga after the 2007 08 season and the 3rd to 10th place finishers in both the Regionalliga Nord and the Regionalliga S d after 2007 08 season. The champions and the runners up of the 3. Liga are promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. The third placed team starts in a home and away play off against the third last team of the 2. Bundesliga. The teams finishing 18th to 20th in the 3. Liga are relegated to the Regionalliga. The Regionalliga was continued with an additional division (West) as fourth level of the league system. 54 teams compete in three regional divisions (North, West, South) of 18 teams each. These 54 teams consist of those Regionalliga teams that did not qualify for the 3. Liga after the 2007 08 season and additional teams from Oberliga feeders. Starting in 2008 09, the winner of each Regionalliga division will be promoted to the 3. Liga. 2012 2017. Starting from the 2012 13 season, the Regionalliga was expanded to five regional divisions. The Northern Division was split into a Northern Division and a North Eastern Division. The Western and the Southern Division were divided into a Western Division, a South/South Western Division and a Bavarian Division. The five Division winners along with the runner up of the South Western Division will compete for 3 promotions spots to the 3. Liga in a play off round. From 2017. Since the 2017 18 season, the Schleswig Holstein Liga is now Oberliga Schleswig Holstein. Scheme. in some areas called Landesliga, in others Verbandsliga. in some areas called Kreisliga A, Kreisliga B, Kreisliga C and Kreisliga D or 1. Kreisklasse, 2. Kreisklasse and 3. Kreisklasse. The league structure has shifted frequently and typically reflects the degree of participation in the sport in various parts of the country. In the early 1990s, changes were driven by German reunification and the subsequent integration of the national leagues of East and West Germany. All these levels are interconnected by way of promotion and relegation. The next diagram shows how this works for the first five levels. Note that the actual number of clubs being promoted and relegated below the Regionalliga level is frequently subject to change by the German Football Association.
Amaechi Cristian Cuevas Morton (born October 30, 1989) is an American born track and field 400 meter hurdler who competes for Nigeria. He was the 2012 400 m hurdles gold medallist at the NCAA Championships and the African Championships. He has a personal record of 48.79 seconds for the event. Morton was born in Atlanta, Georgia to a Nigerian mother of Igbo descent, Nkem Sabena Obiekwe. He holds dual American/Nigerian citizenship. He attended Riverwood High School and while there he broke the school records in the 400 m hurdles and the 400 meter dash, as well as finishing second at the 2008 USATF Junior Olympics. He gained an athletic scholarship at Stanford University and began competing for the Stanford Cardinal in 2009. Responding to the advice of Patience Itanyi (a Nigerian Olympian), Morton opted to compete internationally for his mother's native Nigeria. In his first year at Stanford, he ran a personal best of 50.11 seconds for the 400 m hurdles, breaking the school's 28 year old record. He came third at the Pac 10 Conference final and was a semi finalist at the NCAA Championships. In July, he travelled to Nigeria and came second in the 400 m dash at the national trials (running a best of 46.10 seconds). He was chosen for the 4 400 meter relay team and helped Nigeria reach the 2009 World Championships final, where they finished eighth. Returning to collegiate competition in 2010, he set a personal record of 48.94 seconds in the hurdles to finish second at the Pac 10 Championships, then earned his first All American honours with a third place finish at the NCAA Outdoors. He set an indoor best of 46.23 seconds over 400 m in January 2011 and was fifth in that event at the NCAA Indoor Championships. He ran a time of 49.43 for third at the Pac 10 Championships and improved one position at the NCAA Outdoors, taking second place in a season's best of 49.08 seconds. The 2012 collegiate season saw Morton develop his skills further. He ran a near personal record (48.95) to win the Pac 10 title and also came second in the 110 meter hurdles. He went undefeated in the 400 m hurdles for Stanford that year and won the NCAA title with a best of 48.79 seconds. Morton discussed his internationally eligibility with both the Athletics Federation of Nigeria and USA Track and Field. He requested to run for the United States and American officials asked for his release from Nigerian duty, but ultimately he continued to represent Nigeria. At the 2012 African Championships in Athletics he won the continental gold medals in both the 400 m hurdles and in the relay. Given that he had achieved the Olympic qualifying standard, he was selected to participate for Nigeria at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
W rzer is a white German wine grape variety that is a crossing of Gew rztraminer and M ller Thurgau. The variety was bred at a German viticultural research station in the town of Alzey in 1932 but wasn't commercially planted on a significant scale until the 1980s. Today there are a little over 100 hectares (250 acres) of the variety planted mostly in the Rheinhessen. The grape has a reputation among growers for being a consistent producer with good yields. Wine styles. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, W rzer tends to produce "overpowering" wines with noticeable alcohol levels.

The Bay City Fireworks Festival is an American Independence Day festival held each year around the 4th of July on the Saginaw River near Veterans Memorial Bridge in Bay City, Michigan. In addition to the fireworks display, the festival also features several days of live concerts, a carnival, boat tours and more. History. The festival originally started in 1962, by resident Richard Davis, and was funded by Bay City's Fraternal Order of Police at a cost of $2,500 dollars. In 1982, the show was moved from a one night affair on the Fourth of July, becoming a weekend festival with three days of fireworks. In 2008, the show included a barge in the middle of the river to make for a third launching site. The fireworks display is usually produced by local fireworks company Wolverine Fireworks, which is based in Kawkawlin, Michigan, less than 10 miles from the site of the festival. 50th anniversary. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of the Bay City fireworks Festival featured 50,000 fireworks shells, and a musically choreographed fireworks display that lasted more than 50 minutes, making it the largest fireworks display ever seen in Michigan at that time. The festival was divided into three separate shows, on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The Friday show featured the colors of area schools who helped raise money for that year's festival. The grand finale on Friday night featured the colors of whichever school raised the most money for the Fireworks Festival throughout the year. While fundraising and setup for the festival is a year round affair, actual set up for the fireworks display in 2012 required over 1,600 hours loading and arranging shells and wires. The shows were all choreographed to music, which were broadcast via speakers set up at Wenonah Park on the Saginaw River's east bank, and Veterans Memorial Park on the river's west bank. Music were broadcast over the radio on 94.5 F.M. Performers included Bull Honkey Deluxe, Jedi Mind Trip, The Magic Bus, and Steel Wheels. Recognition. In 2012, the Bay City Fireworks Festival made a national list of great fireworks shows, as chosen by voters.
is a Japanese researcher in anesthesiology, who in 2012 was found to have fabricated data in at least 183 scientific papers, setting what is believed to be a record for the number of papers by a single author requiring retractions. Summary of professional career. Fujii graduated from Tokai University School of Medicine in 1987 and holds an M.D. degree. He attended the Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, where he majored in anesthesiology and received his Ph.D. in 1991. During his career, he worked at institutions including Tokyo Medical and Dental University, the University of Tsukuba, and Toho University. According to an online CV, he spent two years in Canada as a research fellow at Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University, before assuming a faculty position at the University of Tsukuba Institute of Clinical Medicine in 1997. He joined the faculty of Toho University in 2005. The main subject of his research publications was clinical trials of medications to treat the nausea and vomiting that often occurs after surgery. In February 2012, after initial investigations into allegations of scientific misconduct, he was dismissed from his position as associate professor of anesthesiology in the Toho University Faculty of Medicine. Research misconduct. Fujii apparently began publishing falsified data in 1993. The first published allegations of research fraud by Fujii appeared in 2000 in a letter to the editor of the journal by Peter Kranke, Christian Apfel, and others. The letter questioned Fujii's reported findings regarding the effectiveness of granisetron in controlling post surgical nausea and vomiting, characterizing the data reported in 47 papers as "incredibly nice" and stating "we became skeptical when we realized that side effects were almost always identical in all groups". A paper published by the same group in 2001 in "Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica" reported "consistent discrepancies" between Fujii's data and other researchers' findings on the efficacy of granisetron. Fujii dismissed the criticisms of his work, insisting that his results were "true" and asking "How much evidence is required to provide adequate proof?" Apfel wrote to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists to alert them to the possible unreliability of Fujii's results, but did not receive any response. No institutional review of Fujii's research was requested and journals continued to accept new papers submitted by Fujii. The editors of "Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia" did not follow up on the fraud allegations against Fujii until about 2010, when its editor and the editors of several other journals began a coordinated investigation into the integrity of Fujii's scientific publications after the editor of the journal "Anaesthesia" voiced new concerns. In March 2012, the editor of "Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia" acknowledged that the journal's response to the allegations made in 2000 had been "inadequate". Two analyses of some of Fujii's publications were released in March 2012. On 7 March, Toho University reported finding that although nine of Fujii's publications were about clinical studies described as having been conducted at Ushiku Aiwa General Hospital, the hospital's ethics committee had given Fujii approval for only one study. Following this discovery, eight of the nine papers were retracted for failure to follow established ethical standards for clinical research. On 8 March, "Anaesthesia" published a report by John Carlisle, a consultant anesthetist in the United Kingdom, on his statistical analysis of the data reported in 168 papers by Fujii. Carlisle used statistical methods to evaluate whether the published distributions of various variables were consistent with the distributions that could be expected to result from random chance. He found that many of the data sets were "extremely unlikely to have arisen by chance", noting that many of the distributions had "likelihoods that are infinitesimally small", citing a calculated probability of 6.78 10 9, or about 1 in 150 million. Accordingly, he recommended that data published by Fujii should be "excluded from meta analyses or reviews" until such time that the unlikely results could be satisfactorily explained. In April, the editors of 23 scientific journals made a public request for an investigation of Fujii's research by the seven Japanese institutions named as affiliations in his published papers. A committee of the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists, headed by Koji Sumikawa of Nagasaki University, undertook an examination of 212 of the 249 papers credited to Fujii. The committee interviewed Fujii's listed co authors and other people who had been involved with Fujii's research. Committee members also attempted to obtain and review laboratory notebooks, patient records, and other raw data from his studies. On 29 June 2012, the committee reported finding that a total of 172 papers contained fabricated data. Of these, 126 papers were determined to have been "totally fabricated". The report stated: "It is as if someone sat at a desk and wrote a novel about a research idea." The committee found that three of the 212 papers were valid. For 37 of the 212 papers, the committee was unable to determine whether data had been fabricated. The investigators observed that Fujii seemed to have been deliberately ambiguous about details such as the dates of the studies and the names of the institutions where they were conducted, apparently to reduce the possibility that his fraud would be detected. Also, by listing co authors from institutions other than his current employer, he conveyed the impression that the papers described studies done at multiple hospitals. Several scientists listed as co authors were not aware that Fujii had included their names on his papers; two named co authors said that their signatures had been forged on a cover letter submitting the paper to the journal. Retraction Watch suggested that the supposed co authors might not have been aware that their names had been misused because the papers had received few citations. Investigators found that one of Fujii's co authors, Hidenori Toyooka, who collaborated with Fujii on "dozens" of papers, may have been aware of the deception. As of 2021, 173 of Fujii's research publications have been retracted, and seven other papers have received an expression of concern. Previous record for retractions. The researcher believed to have previously held the record for the most retractions of scientific papers by a single author was another anesthesiologist, Joachim Boldt of Germany, author of about 90 papers that required retractions.

Don't Blow the Inheritance is a 5:00pm daytime quiz show that aired on ITV from 20 to 31 August 2012 for a 10 episode run as a summer replacement for "The Chase" the other being "Tipping Point". It was hosted by stand up comedian Tim Vine. Format. Four teams, each composed of two family members from different generations ("offspring" and "elder"), compete on each episode to build up as large a prize pot ("inheritance fund") as possible. The two members of each team may not confer at any time and are positioned so that neither can see the other's face. At the end of each round, the team with the lowest total is eliminated with no winnings. If there is a tie for low score, a sudden death question is asked on the buzzer in the same format as Round One (see below); a correct answer allows the team to continue in the game, but a miss eliminates them. Round One (Questions Requiring Answers). The host asks a series of 15 general knowledge toss up questions, for which only the offspring may buzz in. As soon as an offspring does so, that team's elder must answer the question. A correct response adds 1,000 to the team's inheritance fund, but a miss awards that amount to all three opposing teams. If an offspring buzzes in while a question is being read, the elder must respond based only on the portion heard up to that point. Round Two (Top 10s). The remaining three teams play this round individually, in descending order of score. Each offspring chooses one of four categories; the host then asks a question, and the elder has 30 seconds to come up with as many of the top 10 answers as possible. (E.g. naming the 10 characters who have made the most appearances on the soap opera "Coronation Street".) Every correct answer is worth 1,000; there are no penalties for incorrect answers, but the elder must wait for the host to indicate whether or not an answer is correct before giving another one. The Semi Final (Clues). Three clues to a subject are revealed, one at a time. As in Round One, only the offspring may buzz in at any time, and the corresponding elder must then guess the subject. A correct answer awards 1,000 to that team, while a miss gives the money to their opponents. A total of 10 subjects are played. The Final Round (Rule Reversal). The offspring of the remaining team must answer a series of questions with no help from their elder. There is initially no fixed time limit for the offspring to respond, and they win the entire inheritance fund by answering the first five questions correctly. However, upon the first miss, the fund begins to decrease in steps, at a rate of 100 per 0.4 second ( 500 every two seconds). They may not return to passed or missed questions. If the offspring gives a total of five correct answers, including any given before the first miss, they win the remaining total in the inheritance fund. If the fund reaches zero, they leave with nothing. A team can win up to 35,000 over the course of the entire game.
Vital is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Western Portugal. Sometimes known under the synonym Malvasia Corado, the variety tends to produce rather neutral flavor wine with low acidity unless the grape is grown in vineyards of high altitude. Another common synonym in the Lisboa VR of the former Estremadura Province is "Malvasia Fina" though ampelographers are not sure if Vital is related to the Malvasia grown widely in Italy, Greece and throughout Europe. One key difference that ampelographers note is that the shape of the leaves of Vital and the various Malvasia species tend to be very different. Even in the Douro DOC there is a Malvasia Fina used in Port wine production that may or may not be the same variety as Vital. List of DOCs. Vital is a permitted variety in several Portuguese wine regions including the following "Denomina o de Origem Controlada" (DOC)s: Winemaking and wine styles. In addition to growing Vital in higher altitude vineyards to maintain acidity, winemakers will often complement Vital's somewhat bland flavors with blending with other varieties or with a little bit of oak aging. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, well made examples of Vital can exhibit an interesting minerality. Synonyms. In addition to Malvasia Corada and Malvasia Fina, Vital is known under several various synonyms including: Boal Bonifacio, Malvazia Corada, Malvasia Fina de Douro, Malvasia Fina do Douro and Malvasia ou Malvazia.

is a Japan based, English and Japanese bilingual poetry print journal founded and originally edited by award winning translator William I. Elliott and internationally acclaimed poet Shuntar Tanikawa. The annual journal, currently edited by Alan Botsford, is published by the Kanto Poetry Center at Kanto Gakuin University in Yokohama, Japan and showcases modern and contemporary Japanese poetry in English translation, as well as contemporary English language poetry from the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Wales, South Africa, Hong Kong, Canada, Ireland, and other countries. Bridging East and West, "Poetry Kanto" features "outstanding poetry that navigates the divide of ocean and language from around the world." Goals. "Poetry Kanto" devotes itself to introducing Japanese poets and English speaking poets to a wide audience at home in Japan and abroad. It aims to promote dialogue between Japan and the English speaking world. Each issue features an in depth look at poets from both sides of the cultural divide, setting up a blend of cultures and traditions unique among literary publications. The hope is for readers to step outside their limited cultural spheres and engage in cross cultural dialogue for a rebirth at the crossroads of culture and imagination. In a recent interview, editor Alan Botsford said, "I feel very fortunate to play a role in a cross cultural mission as wall as literary exploration. I think cultural identity and that struggle, for many people across the globe, the struggle of cultural identity per se and also between cultures, speaks to what Poetry Kanto tries to offer. As editor, I envision Poetry Kanto as a transformative space where poetry's insights are made available for, and can engage the entire range of, cultures, not just getting into the cultural mix but adding to it, enriching it, fermenting it beyond our ideas of Japaneseness and Americanness." History. The journal's origins can be traced back to the founding of the Kanto Poetry Center in 1968 by Professor Emeritus William I. Elliott, when he proposed a four fold center to be housed at Kanto Gakuin University the first of its kind and scope in Japan, to include a library of contemporary poetry, a poetry journal, regular poetry readings in the university, and an annual poetry conference. The Center, modeled after American counterparts, was originally directed by Kanto Gakuin's Prof. Naoyuki Yagy and his colleagues, Kazuo Kawamura and William I. Elliott, and has over the years sought, in Elliott's words, "to promote the health of poetry both as an art and a discipline within university structures." The Center has carried on by the cooperation and funding of successive university presidents, from 1968 to the present. The Center has held poetry readings with many readers, including Shuntar Tanikawa, Naoko Kudo, Masayo Koike, Arthur Binard, and Kisako Ry . It also successfully launched the bilingual journal "Poetry Kanto", and continued holding its annual conference until 2005, when the founding editors retired. Over the years, the Center's annual conference, or Summer Institute Program, featured among the non Japanese poet readers lecturers and seminar teachers James Kirkup, Gary Snyder, Harry Guest, William Stafford, Denise Levertov, W.S. Merwin, Seamus Heaney, Les Murray and Jon Silkin, with the preponderance of the logistics of the conference carried out by Kazuo Kawamura. "Poetry Kanto" was first published in 1968 to present to the participants of the Kanto Poetry Summer Institute Program. The second issue appeared in 1970, after which a dozen year hiatus followed. The journal resumed publication again in 1984 and has been in continuous publication ever since, with Elliott and Tanikawa at the English and Japanese editorial helms, respectively. As of 2005, issue number 21, the "baton" was passed to co editors Alan Botsford and Nishihara Katsumasa with an advisory board consisting of Shuntar Tanikawa, Kazuo Kawamura and William I. Elliott, but in 2011, issue number 27, Botsford became sole editor. In 2005 the look of "Poetry Kanto" changed, with the professional designer/publisher's services shifting from Tokyo to Kamakura, the headquarters of the small but growing literary publisher Minato no hito (literally "a guy at the harbor", taken from the title of Tar Kitamura's poem). Featured Poets. Since 2005, "Poetry Kanto" has featured a wide and diverse range of poets such as Gwyneth Lewis, Ilya Kaminsky, Beth Ann Fennelly, Vijay Seshadri, Harryette Mullen, Ellen Bass, Rigoberto Gonz lez, Ayukawa Nobuo, Tar Kitamura, Akira Tatehata, Shuntar Tanikawa, Gregory Orr, Michael Sowder, Ann Fisher Wirth, Sarah Arvio, Michele Leggott, Sabur Kuroda, Rin Ishigaki, Kiyoko Nagase, Toriko Takarabe, Inuo Taguchi, Hiroshi Kawasaki, Mari L'Esperance, Ekiawah Adler Belendez, William Heyen, Linda Ann Strang, J.P.

He published his article "Conjectures on the Union of the Soul and Body" in the Journal in 1703, supporting the views of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The journal was seen as biased in its discussions of politics and religion due to its association with the Jesuits. The "Memoires de Trevoux" inspired the launch of various rival journals, but none lasted for long. In 1733 the Duke of Maine, tired of constant complaints, removed his protection from the editors. They moved to Paris, where they continued production until the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1762. Among the contributing editors were Pierre Brumoy, Fran ois Catrou, one of the founding editors and one of the most prolific contributors for twelve years; No l tienne Sanadon, a translator of Horace and student of antiquity; and Ren Joseph Tournemine, a scholar whose nobility and purity of language was praised by Voltaire. The chief editor from 1737 to 1745 was P. de Charlevoix, formerly a missionary to Canada. He was succeeded by Guillaume Fran ois Berthier, one of the authors of the multi volume "Histoire de l' glise Gallicane", who held the post until 1762 and did much to expand the circulation. The Jesuits were banished from France in 1762, and Berthier promptly resigned. Several other editors struggled to keep it running, but by 1777 it was down to 200 subscribers. It was renamed "Journal de Litt rature, des Sciences et des Arts", finally disappearing in 1782. Philosophy. The criticism in the journal was generally solid, intelligent, neutral and in good taste, written by educated men who avoided excess, even in their criticism of enemies such as Voltaire. The reviews were elegantly written, and maintained a cool and polite tone, generally avoiding personal attacks. Berthier generally stated his opinions calmly and clearly, giving a solid tone to the periodical that enhanced its authority. The magazine also covered scientific and technical subjects that were unrelated to the more radical political and social concepts of the time, giving an impression of independence from government pressure. The journal supported a cosmopolitan view of culture as opposed to a narrow nationalistic one. It also took an enlightened view of science, including a belief in empiricism. However, the journal attacked the writings of the philosophes when they attacked religion. The journal played up the evils that resulted from the beliefs of the philosophes, which would destroy public morality. The journal took Catholic orthodoxy as received truth, treating religious writings with great respect. The "Journal" made personal attacks on the materialists, whom it considered more dangerous even than the encyclop distes.

The 1805 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election occurred on October 8, 1805. Incumbent governor Thomas McKean won a contentious election over the endorsed Democratic Republican candidate, Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Simon Snyder. Although the Democratic Republicans united behind the McKean ticket in each of the prior two election cycles, by 1805, the party had divided into moderate and radical wings. The former sought to balance the political power of the traditional elite and the lower classes; this group additionally supported liberal economic policies. The latter sought to directly increase political and economic opportunities for poor and working men. After the radicals took control of the state legislature under Snyder, they clashed with the moderate aligned McKean. Democratic Republican newspapers were dominated by radical interests, and the press vociferously denounced McKean's support for strong executive and judicial power. The governor formed a working alliance with the Federalists called "the quids" and began to purge radicals from appointed offices. McKean ultimately won reelection by a six point margin.

Leptogorgia hebes, commonly known as the regal sea fan or false sea fan, is a species of soft coral in the family Gorgoniidae. It was formerly included in the genus "Lophogorgia" but that genus has been dismantled. Description. The regal sea fan is a colonial coral averaging about in height. It has a horny axial skeleton made of a fibrous protein called gorgonin covered with coenenchyme, a thin layer of living tissue from which the polyps protrude. Embedded in the coenenchyme are minute capstan shaped and rod shaped calcified sclerites. As well as strengthening the tissue, these are distasteful to most predators. The coral is densely branched but usually grows in a single plane. The colour varies and is usually some shade of red, orange or deep yellow but purple specimens occasionally occur. The skeleton is not rigid so the whole fan like structure can sway with the movement of the surrounding water. The polyps are white and project in alternate rows from slit shaped openings in hemispherical calyces on the branches. Each polyp can retract into its calyx and has eight pinnate tentacles and eight mesenteries dividing the body cavity. The whole colony has a single siphonoglyph, an opening through which water enters the structure. Distribution. The regal sea fan is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from Chesapeake Bay, Georgia and Florida to the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Venezuela and Brazil. It is found on shallow reefs at depths ranging from . It is tolerant of low salinity levels (26 to 36 parts per thousand of salt equivalent) and a moderate degree of wave action. It usually grows on limestone or rock ledges. Biology. The polyps of the regal sea fan extend their tentacles to feed and gather plankton and small organisms from the surrounding water. Individual colonies are either male or female. Females start breeding at the age of two whereas the males do not do so until they are six years old. In a study in the Gulf of Mexico, where this species is a dominant member of the shallow reef community, it was found that the female gonads began developing in January and the male gonads in April. Both became ripe in August when the eggs and sperm were liberated into the sea in a synchronised spawning event. It was unclear precisely what triggered the spawning but it may have been connected to the date of the full moon. Ecology. The regal sea fan is part of a biodiverse reef community. Amphipods such as "Ericthonius brasiliensis" are often found climbing on the branches which provide them with an elevated position from which to feed. The skeleton shrimp ("Caprella equilibra") grasps the sea fan with its posterior appendages and resembles a bit of attached seaweed. The sea whip slug ("Tritonia wellsi") feeds on the soft tissues of the sea fan. It is difficult to detect because it is disguised by having numerous small appendages called cerata which closely resemble the sea fan polyps. Another well disguised predator is the sea whip shrimp ("Neopontonides beaufortensis ").
Morley was a town in Las Animas County, Colorado, that existed between 1878 and 1956. The town was located near the summit of Raton Pass and was originally a railroad stop before being developed into a coal mining town by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&amp;I). Morley was a CF&amp;I company town for fifty years until 1956 when the mine was closed and the town demolished. History. The site of the town was originally named "Cima", which means "summit" or "high place", by Spanish traders who traveled through the region in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It was first developed by the Santa Fe Railroad Company in 1878 as a railroad stop and a place to house railroad workers. The town was built in 1906, when the land was taken over by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company for coal mining. The coal was mined and shipped north to CF&amp;I's steel production plant in Pueblo, Colorado. The company owned the entire town and almost all residents were either CF&amp;I employees or they were related to an employee. At its peak in the 1920s the town had over 600 residents, its own post office, grade school, and church. The mine produced an average of 600 tons of coal per day and by the time it closed had yielded over 11 million tons of coal. Besides being used to produce steel at the Pueblo plant, the coal was also used to power the steam powered Santa Fe Railroad trains that came through the area, to produce electricity and to power coal processing machinery in the town itself. CF&amp;I officials began considering closing the mine during the recession of 1949. The quantity of coal yields had dropped to less than half of their peak level, and labor disputes were reducing the mine's cost effectiveness. Feeding and maintaining the mules became expensive, compared to the cost of using electrical equipment, like those used at the other mines. For example, the average mule consumed over 10 pounds of oats and a bale of hay per day and there were nearly 150 mules working at the mine. CF&amp;I began laying off workers in 1950, and by 1955 there were perhaps only two dozen workers remaining. The local school closed that year, forcing students to be bused to the city of Trinidad twenty miles north. Finally, in 1956, the mine was closed. CF&amp;I demolished all the company buildings that remained because they didn't want to assume liability for squatters or trespassers. They did, however, leave the old St. Aloysius Catholic Church standing. The demolition crew felt it was sacrilegious to tear down "holy ground," and part of the church ruins remains to this day. Most of the former employees and their families relocated to Trinidad or to Raton, New Mexico. Today, Interstate 25/US Highway 87 and the Santa Fe/Amtrak rail line run pass the former town. Some ruins can still be seen, the most notable being the old St. Aloysius Church, with its Spanish colonial style bell tower. In 2011 a real estate development group attempted to buy the land where the town and church stood. Their goal was to rebuild the church and part of the town as a tourist attraction. There would have been a coal mining museum and shops reenacting life in the town during the 1920s. But nearby residents opposed the plan, mostly because they did not want outside visitors disturbing the peace and tranquility of the area.

Brasilennea is a fossil genus of small to medium sized air breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropods in the family Cerionidae. The genus is known only from the Brazilian Paleocene Itabora Basin, in Rio de Janeiro. The most characteristic feature of the genus is its two spiral furrows on the body whorl. The generic name "Brasilennea" originally intended to imply that it is a Brazilian genus that is very similar and related to the African genus "Ennea". This is no longer the case, however: while the genus was originally classified in the family Streptaxidae, "Brasilennea" was then later transferred to the family Cerionidae. Species. Species within the genus "Brasilennea" include:

Bon Albert Briois de Beaumetz or Beaumez (23 December 1755 1801?) was a French statesman of the French Revolution. He is noteworthy as a conservative nobleman who nevertheless committed to serve the constitutional monarchy of the Constitution of 1791. Biography. Born in Arras, Albert de Beaumetz was the son of an ardent royalist and a "premier pr sident" of the Superior Council of Artois, a judiciary body of the ancien r gime. In 1785, Beaumetz succeeded his father at the Council of Artois and became himself a distinguished personality. He was the lover of Jeanne Louise Henriette Genest Campan, a lady in waiting for Marie Antoinette. Each week, he entertained at his home the most important figures of the bar of Arras. It was to one of these meetings, in which the election campaign for the Estates General of 1789 was planned, that Maximilien Robespierre, member of the Artesian bar, was not invited. It revived an animosity between the erstwhile friends. French Revolution. In the elections to the Estates General, Bon Albert de Beaumetz was elected as a member by the Second Estate of the Artois, while Maximilien Robespierre managed to get elected by the Third Estate. In the subsequent National Constituent Assembly, Beaumetz sat on the right side with conservatives such as the comte de Clermont Tonnerre, yet is moderate in his conservatism. His interventions are many. He opted for the meeting of the three orders, called for the abolition of torture in the judicial procedure and requested the emission of 800 million assignat. After the close of the session of the Constituent Assembly in 1791, he became with Charles Maurice of Talleyrand P rigord a member of the directory of the department of the Seine. He tried in vain to put a brake on the rise of revolutionary violence, much more than his friend and colleague, the Bishop of Autun. He was, in spite of everything, the origin of the counter revolutionary measures which this body had taken. migr . After the day of fall of the French Monarchy (10 August 1792), Beaumetz emigrated, first to Germany, and then to England, where he found his friend Charles Maurice of Talleyrand P rigord in the spring of 1794. They traveled together to the United States. Having married the daughter of first United States Secretary of War Henry Knox, he was naturalised as an American citizen. In May 1796, accompanied by his wife, he travelled to India and was installed in Calcutta where he disappeared from history after a last letter sent by him in March 1801.

The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) is an instrument consisting of 31 principles implementing the United Nations' (UN) "Protect, Respect and Remedy" framework on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. Developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) John Ruggie, these Guiding Principles provided the first global standard for preventing and addressing the risk of adverse impacts on human rights linked to business activity, and continue to provide the internationally accepted framework for enhancing standards and practice regarding business and human rights. On June 16, 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council unanimously endorsed the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, making the framework the first corporate human rights responsibility initiative to be endorsed by the UN. The UNGPs encompass three pillars outlining how states and businesses should implement the framework: The UNGPs have received wide support from states, civil society organizations, and even the private sector, this has further solidified their status as the key global foundation for business and human rights. The UNGP are informally known as the "Ruggie Principles" or the "Ruggie Framework" due to their authorship by Ruggie, who conceived them and led the process for their consultation and implementation. History. The UNGPs came as a result of several decades of UN efforts to create global human rights standards for businesses. In the early 1970s, the United Nations Economic and Social Council requested that the Secretary General create a commission group to study the impact of transnational corporations (TNCs) on development processes and international relations. The UN created the Commission on Transnational Corporations in 1973, with the goal of formulating a corporate code of conduct for TNCs. The Commission's work continued into the early 1990s, but the group was ultimately unable to ratify an agreeable code due to various disagreements between developed and developing countries. The group was dissolved in 1994. The debate concerning the responsibilities of business in relation to human rights became prominent in the 1990s, as oil, gas, and mining companies expanded into increasingly difficult areas, and as the practice of off shore production in clothing and footwear drew attention to poor working conditions in global supply chains. Flowing from these concerns two major initiatives were created. In August 1998, the UN Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights established a Working Group on Transnational Corporations. The Working Group similarly attempted to create standards for corporations' human rights obligations. By 2003 they completed the final draft of the Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises with Regard to Human Rights (the Norms). While the Norms received support from some NGO's, such as the Europe Third World Centre (CETIM) or Amnesty International, the document encountered significant opposition from the business sector, and the Commission on Human Rights ultimately determined in 2004 that the framework had no legal standing. In 2005, in an attempt to overcome the divisive debate regarding the human rights responsibilities of businesses, the Human Rights Commission requested the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) on the issue of human rights and TNCs. In July 2005, Harvard professor John Ruggie was appointed to this position for an initial two year period which was then extended for an additional year. In 2008, on completion of his first three year mandate, Ruggie presented the United Nations Human Rights Council with the Protect, Respect and Remedy framework as a conceptual way to anchor the debate. This framework outlined the State duty to protect against business related human rights abuse, the responsibility of companies to respect human rights, and the need to strengthen access to appropriate and effective remedies for victims of business related human rights abuse. The Human Rights Council welcomed Ruggie's report and extended his mandate until 2011 with the task of "operationalising" and "promoting" the framework. The Human Rights Council asked Ruggie to provide concrete recommendations on how the state could prevent abuses by the private sector, to elaborate on the scope of corporate responsibility, and to explore options for effective remedies available to those whose human rights are impacted by corporate activities. Over the next three years, Ruggie held extensive consultations with stakeholder groups including governments, businesses, and NGOs. Ruggie intended to create "an authoritative focal point around which actors' expectations could converge a framework that clarified the relevant actors' responsibilities, and provided the foundation which thinking and action could build over time". Ruggie's work resulted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which he presented to the Human Rights Council in June 2011. Ruggie stated, The Human Rights Council unanimously endorsed the Guiding Principles, thereby creating the first global standard on this topic. In June 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 17/4, it acknowledged the formal end of the mandate of Ruggie as the SRSG on Human Rights and TNCs and Other Enterprises, and unanimously endorsed the Guiding Principles making them the authoritative global reference point on business and human rights. Additionally, the Council established a working group to focus on the global dissemination and implementation of the Guiding Principles. OHCHR provides ongoing support and advice to the Working Group, which consists of five independent experts, of balanced regional representation, for a three year period. Current Working Group Members are: Mr. Surya Deva (Chair from 1 July 2021) (India), since 2016; Ms. El bieta Karska (Vice chair from 1 July 2021) (Poland), since 2018; Mr. Dante Pesce; (Chile), since 2015; Mr. Githu Muigai (Kenya), since 2018; and Ms. Anita Ramasastry (USA), since 2016. The first Forum on Business and Human Rights took place on December 4 5, 2012, in Geneva, Switzerland. The three pillars. State duty to protect human rights. The first pillar of the Guiding Principles is the state's duty to protect against human rights abuses through regulation, policymaking, investigation, and enforcement. This pillar reaffirms states' existing obligations under international human rights law, as put forth in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Issues in Conflict affected areas. An area which has been the subject of much scrutiny under the first pillar is in regards to support business respect of human rights in conflict affected areas under guiding principle 7. The first apparent issue with this principle is the interpretation of the term "conflict affected areas". This terminology was employed by the SRSG to reflect the intention to expand the principles coverage beyond definitions of armed conflict in international humanitarian law. When defining the application of principle 7, consideration must be given to the flexible definition boundaries that the UNGP, as a soft law instrument, employs and also guidance based nature of the principle. Where the issue with interpretation of principle 7 arises is to what types of conflict are to be left out of the principle. Another area of uncertainty which exists is in the relation between 'gross abuses' and 'conflict affected areas' which impact directly on the applicability of principle 7 to serious violations within conflict zones that require home states action to influence companies operating within the area. Gross violations of human rights occurs both in conflict areas, and areas absent of a conflict, such as in repressive States and dictatorships. The question recognised here is whether principle 7 applies to gross abuses in non conflict affected areas. Additionally, does principle 7 have equal application across democratic, authoritarian, and oppressive States where gross abuses that have arisen in conflicts or is the principles application dependent on the State losing control over its territory. Corporate responsibility to respect. Businesses must act with due diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to address any negative impacts. The UNGPs hold that companies have the power to affect virtually all of the internationally recognized rights. Therefore, there is a responsibility of both the state and the private sector to acknowledge their role in upholding and protecting human rights. In conducting due diligence, the UNGP encourage companies to conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment through which they assess their actual and potential human rights impacts. Access to remedy if these rights are not respected. The third pillar addresses both the state's responsibility to provide access to remedy through judicial, administrative, and legislative means, and the corporate responsibility to prevent and remediate any infringement of rights that they contribute to. Having effective grievance mechanisms in place is crucial in upholding the state's duty to protect and the corporate responsibility to respect. The UNGPs dictate that non judicial mechanisms, whether state based or independent, should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, rights compatible, equitable, and transparent. Similarly, Company level mechanisms are encouraged to operate through dialogue and engagement, rather than with the company acting as the adjudicator of its own actions. Issues with access to home state remedies. An issue raised with the third pillar of the Guiding Principles is the challenge of providing effective remedies for victims, particularly with judicial remedy to victims of transnational corporations that operate in more than one state. Ruggie notes that the Guiding Principles are more effective at identifying inadequate access to judicial remedy than fixing it. He conveys that where the guiding principles fall short is that they set out to identify obstacles and encourage States to overcome them, but fail to ensure it occurs in practice. The Guiding Principles failed to recognise the power imbalance in terms of resources and information between victims of corporate abuse and the businesses themselves. Another issue relates to the Commentary to Guiding Principle 2 which provides that home states "are permitted" to take measures ensuring access to remedies. This language has been heavily criticised for being timid and unambiguous where victims of abuse by multinational corporations routinely face insurmountable obstacles to remedy in the host state and have no other place to turn for help. Here the Guiding Principles have failed to specifically provide clear guidance on how to navigate the procedural and substantive barriers to home state remedies and failed to elaborate on 'governance gaps' to assist home states to implement mechanisms ensuring their corporations do not violate human rights abroad. Additionally, commentators have also raised concerns regarding the over emphasis on non judicial mechanisms and voluntary mechanisms which don not guarantee victims sufficient protection against business related human rights abuses. What is suggested is that the Guiding Principles should have established comprehensive remedies that legally binding and consistent with human rights obligations of states and businesses both in the host state and home state. Effective local capacity is the preferred option to guarantee general access to civil judicial remedies in the long run. Response and implementation. The UNGPs have enjoyed widespread uptake and support from both the public and private sectors, and several companies have publicly stated their support. For example, the Coca Cola Company "strongly endorsed" the UNGPs, calling them "a foundation and flexible framework for companies like ours", and General Electric wrote that the UNGPs "helped to clarify the distinct interrelated roles and responsibilities of states and business entities in this area" and that they would "no doubt serve as a lasting beacon for businesses entities seeking (to) grow their service and product offerings while respecting human rights". The UNGPs have also faced criticism, particularly from human rights NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, who argue that the lack of an enforcement mechanism, they cannot actually require companies to do anything at all. Companies can reject the principles altogether without consequence or publicly embrace them while doing absolutely nothing to put them into practice. The UNGPs have generated lessons for international law, particularly concerning the role of non State actors in international law and also the evolving significance of soft law sources. The success of the UNGPs may be attributed to the role played by non State actors, especially in this context, the lobbying of the business community. What the influence of the UNGPs stands to illustrate is that the development of international law norms such as those concerning diplomacy and international organisations will continue to draw on contributions of State actors. However, the development in areas such as international economic law and international environmental law which directly impact non State actors, may require a different approach from the traditional State centred process and draw on the observations and inputs of non state actors if effective laws are to be created in these areas. A legally binding instrument. Despite the support from the public and private sectors, some stakeholders questioned whether the UNGPs set a sufficiently high standard for businesses, arguing that the private sector should have an "obligation" to realise rights, rather than simply a "responsibility". Others argued that the UNGPs needed an overarching accountability mechanism that could make the framework legally enforceable. Supporters, however, defend the UNGPs for creating far more consensus than any previous attempt at creating a global business human rights standard. The debate about the sufficiency of a voluntary soft law approach that underlie the Guiding Principles, however, reopened in September 2013 when Ecuador, backed by 84 governments proposed a binding legal instrument for TNC operations in order to provide appropriate protection, justice and remedy to the victims of human rights abuses directly resulting from or related to the activities of some transnational corporations and other business enterprises. The call was backed by more than 530 civil society organisations (CSOs) and in June 2014 was backed by a majority of the UN Human Rights Council which agreed to establish an open ended intergovernmental working group mandated to draft a binding instrument. Scope. An issue raised by Ruggie with regards to the introduction of a legally binding international business and human rights treaty is determining the scope and scale of such an instrument. One view is that a treaty would be more effective than the UNGPs in specific areas of business and human rights. For example, a treaty could explicitly refer to the rights of Indigenous peoples or recognise labour rights beyond those established in the UNGPs. Conversely, Ruggie has long illustrated his strong objection to any attempt to shoehorning the entire complex of business and human rights issues into a single, overarching international legal instrument. His explanation is that business and human rights involves a wide range of diverse problems, legal and institutional variations, as well as conflicting interest between and within States. Furthermore, a general business and human rights treaty would have to be constructed at such a high level of abstraction that any practical applicability would be diminished. In this sense, the UNGPs are more favourable because being a "soft law" instrument has allow them be comprehensive and more appealing to Governments. Relationship with Guiding Principles. The prospect of a legally binding treaty raises questions as to the potential for tension between the proposed binding instrument and the UNGPs and ensuring the treaty making process does not undermine the progress made under UNGPs. Sceptics of a comprehensive binding treaty stressed the need to recognise the risk associated with a bad treaty that would create issues from a civil society perspective such as having principles that may be widely agreed upon by states, but lack clarity in what they require in practice. Conversely, others have conveyed that a binding instrument in conjunction with other initiatives, such as the UNGPs, would further developing international law in this area as it would complement existing instruments. This perspective depicts a proposed treaty to be just one aspect within a developing comprehensive system aimed at regulating business and human rights. Enforcement. Another fundamental issue which has been raised is how such a treaty would be enforced, seeing as inadequate enforcement is highlighted as the main shortcoming of the UNGPs. Ruggie, in his contemplation questions whether a realistic prospect would be to establish an international court for corporations or whether such a treaty could be enforced by states. In his analysis, Ruggie sided with the former highlighting that where a State ratifies a treaty, it already has obligations to protect individuals against human rights breaches by third parties within their territories. So to add any new value, treaty enforcement provisions would have to involve extraterritorial jurisdiction which, despite being supported by some UN human rights treaty bodies, is conveyed by the conduct of states to be an unacceptable means to address violations of human rights. States that have not ratified a core UN or ILO human rights instrument are very unlikely to support or enforce a treaty imposing obligations on the overseas operations of their MNCs.

The Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy was a Klan faction led by Asa Carter in the late 1950s. Despite the group's brief lifespan, it left its mark with a violent record, including an assault on Nat King Cole, participation in a riot in Clinton, Tennessee, and one of the few documented cases of castration by the Klan. Origins. The group began as the North Alabama Citizens Council, which broke away from the Citizens' Councils of America in October 1955. The new organization was based in Birmingham, while the mainstream group was headquartered in Montgomery and led by State Senator Sam Englehart. The split apparently centered around the Birmingham group's embrace of antisemitism and exclusion of Jews from membership, while the Montgomery faction professed no other aim than the defense of segregation. Carter also insisted that "the mountain people the real redneck is our strength". Rock music and Cole assault. The group had a particular disdain for black music and rock'n'roll, campaigning for boycotts of black singers and the removal of rock'n'roll records from local juke boxes. A sign outside Carters office proclaimed "Be bop promotes Communism". On April 10, 1956 seven members of the group assaulted Nat King Cole while he was singing to a white audience at the Municipal Auditorium in Birmingham. The assault was supposed to be part of a much larger attack involving one hundred members who were supposed to overpower the band and the police, but only seven showed up. On April 18, four of the assailants were sentenced to 180 days in jail and a $100 fine, the maximum for their assault charge, and three others were fined for conspiracy and weapons charges. Clinton, Tennessee. Also that April, Adm. John Crommelin, introduced Carter to John Kasper who set up an affiliate of the NACC in Washington, D.C. that June called the Seabord White Citizens Council. In August and September 1956, both groups converged on Clinton, Tennessee, to prevent the court ordered integration of Clinton High School. Kasper was arrested on August 27 for inciting a riot and vagrancy, but released the next day for lack of evidence. The local school board then petitioned Federal Judge Robert Love Taylor to issue a restraining order against him for interfering with school integration. The order was served to him while he was in the middle of a speech on the courthouse lawn. After being served, Kasper went on with his speech, telling the audience of about 1,000 people that the injunction did not matter. He was promptly arrested for violating the order. he was found guilty, but held over for an appeal. While a judge mulled whether or not to grant Kasper bail, Asa Carter arrived on the scene and the crowds he gathered grew to a reported 1,500. On September 1 2, full scale riots broke out, with mobs attacking black motorists, shots being fired at the court house, and a dynamite blast in the black section of nearby Oliver Springs. The small police department deputized a posse "home guard" which used tear gas to disperse the crowds. Governor Frank G. Clement sent in the National Guard and Tennessee Highway Patrol to restore order. Bail was granted on a $10,000 bond with an injunction that Carter cease his activities. Nevertheless, later that month Kasper addressed a gathering of the North Alabama Citizens Council, welcoming robed Klansmen and stating "We need all the rabble rousers we can get, We want trouble, and we want it everywhere we can get it." He also called for "roving bands of patriots" to descend on any city threatened with integration. Carter and his group went to Clinton in September 1957. Reorganization and Aaron castration. In November 1956, the Northern Alabama Citizens Council was replaced by the Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy. Thirty five Klansmen were initiated in a ceremony in Birmingham on Nov. 15 before a bonfire of skulls where they pledged to "fight the enemies of Jesus Christ to the bitter end and after". The new organization was organized along military lines, being divided into "squads and platoons with areas of responsibility" and Nazi style brownshirt uniforms. The group was incorporated in Birmingham the next month. On 27 December 1956, during the Montgomery bus boycott, Carter announced plans to send in troops of "Minutemen" to patrol city buses to enforce segregation. In January 1957 Carter and four of his followers were arrested for a shoot out that occurred between different members of the group after one member, J. P. Tillery, made accusations about administrative and financial irregularities. At the time of the shooting the group had less than 100 members. The group's most infamous attack came on September 2, 1957. In a move to counter attempts by the Rev. F. L. Shuttlesworth to desegregate Birmingham schools six members of the group (Bart Floyd, Joseph Pritchett, James N. Griffin, William Miller, Jesse Mabry, and Grover McCollough) abducted Judge Edward Aaron from Birmingham and took him to their "lair" a small dirt floor house outside of Clarkesville, Alabama. There, by the glow of lamplight they performed a castration on him. The event was supervised by Exalted Cyclops Joe Pritchett, wearing a red trimmed Klan robe. The scrotum was preserved as a souvenir, while turpentine was poured on Aaron's wounds. Aaron was left for dead on the side of the road until a motorist found him and drove him to a local hospital. Joe Pritchett was found guilty of the crime and sentenced to 20 years in prison on October 31. The jury only took 40 minutes to deliberate the case. Judge Alta King gave him the maximum penalty, 20 years in prison. The judge stated the offense was one of the worst crimes he had encountered in his 35 years of experience. Klabee Jesse Mabry, who had participated in the assault on Nat King Cole; Bart Floyd, who was the one who actually performed the castration in order to become a captain within the group; and Grover McCullough drew identical sentences. William Miller, another recently appointed captain, and John Griffin, who stood guard outside the shack and did not know the details of what happened until after the fact, turned state's evidence and got terms of probation. Those sentenced to jail exhausted their appeals and began their prison terms in 1959. In 1960 the parole board ruled that they would have to serve one third of their sentence six years and eight months before they could be considered for parole. However, the inmates began receiving preferential treatment after George Wallace became governor, and the parole boards decision was reversed in July 1963, after Wallace had made his first appointment to the board. Mabry was released in February 1964, and the others in 1965. The organization itself dissolved sometime in early 1958. Asa Carter went on to become a speechwriter for George Wallace.
Tanya Nicole Kach McCrum (born October 14, 1981) is an American woman who was held captive for ten years by a security guard who worked at the school she attended. Her captor, Thomas Hose, eventually pleaded guilty to involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and other related offenses and was sentenced to five to fifteen years in prison. Captivity. Thomas Hose was a security guard at Cornell Middle School in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, where Kach was an eighth grade student. Hose befriended Kach, often taking her out of classes to talk to her, and one day when he caught her skipping class, he kissed her. Over time, Hose convinced Kach to run away from her family and move in with him, which she did in February 1996. She was 14 years old at the time. For the first four years, she was not allowed out of the house. Hose lived with his parents and son, and went to great lengths to keep Kach hidden from them. She was confined entirely to his second story bedroom, and had to go to the toilet in a bucket. In 2000, Hose created a new identity for Kach, "Nikki Allen", and introduced her to his parents as his girlfriend who would be moving in with them. After this, she was occasionally allowed to leave the house but had a strict curfew. Six years later, she escaped. In 2007, Hose pled guilty to three counts of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, statutory sexual assault, interfering with the custody of a child, corruption of a minor and child endangerment. Escape and later life. After being allowed some time outside of the house, Kach began to realize that her relationship with Hose was not normal. She escaped from captivity on March 21, 2006, with the help of Joe Sparico, a grocery store owner in her neighborhood, by revealing her true identity to him and asking him to send police to the house. Kach was happy to be reunited with her family, but has since become estranged from her father. Through her marriage in September 2018, she has a stepdaughter and stepson and is grandmother to her stepson's young children. Since her escape, Kach attempted to sue numerous government organizations for their failing of her, including the police and school board. All were thrown out of court. She has also written a "New York Times" bestselling book titled "Memoir of a Milk Carton Kid: The Tanya Nicole Kach Story".

Professor Hugh Alexander Webster , FRSGS (1849 7 January 1926) was a Scottish teacher, librarian and encyclopaedist. Biography. The son of Rev David Webster and Isabella McKinnon, Hugh Webster was born in Laurencekirk, Kincardineshire, and educated first privately by his father and later at Edinburgh University (1878 80). He became a teacher at Merchiston Castle Academy and later Librarian at the University. He was a member of a group of encyclopaedists working in Edinburgh in the late 19th century including William Robertson Smith (editor of the "Encyclop dia Britannica" and contributor to the "Encyclopaedia Biblica"); David Patrick (editor of "Chambers's Encyclopaedia", "Chambers's Biographical Dictionary", and "Chambers's Cyclopaedia of English Literature"); J Sutherland Black (editor of Encyclopaedia Biblica); George Sandeman, (editor in chief of Nelson's Encyclopaedia) and Patrick Geddes. Hugh Webster was fluent in fourteen languages which allowed him to access sources from European and Asian writers. Patrick Geddes, writing from Montpellier in 1926 said: Geddes also reported a comment from his friend and colleague George Sandeman Hugh Webster was one of four sub editors of the 9th edition of the Encyclop dia Britannica, published in 1888 and known as "The Scholar's Edition".

Hugh Webster was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh FRSE on 2 May 1887 proposed by Sir John Murray, William Evans Hoyle, Robert Gray, Alexander Buchan. His election was cancelled in 1896 7. He was a founder member and the first Honorary Fellow of the Scottish Geographical Society and edited the Society's magazine for several years. Hugh Webster had intense powers of mental application and was quite capable of forgetting both time and place.

The Velocity V Twin is an American twin engined, homebuilt aircraft, designed by Velocity Aircraft and following the layout of their earlier Velocity XL but with a single vertical tail. It is the flagship model of the Velocity Aircraft Line. Development. The Velocity V Twin is a four seat (with a five seat option), retractable tricycle landing gear, composite construction aircraft with a twin engined pusher configuration and the canard layout of the Velocity XL single engine aircraft. Its fuselage is that of the XL RG, with the addition of the single, vertical surface which replaces the twin end plate fins of the smaller XL. The aircraft features "gull wing" car like doors and dual sidestick controllers. The flight control surfaces are the same as those of the XL. The aircraft's design goal was to offer the safety of twin engines without the stall and spin risks of a conventional twin during single engine operations. The rear facing pusher propellers are mounted close together where the fuselage cross section tapers, reducing asymmetrical single engine thrust yawing compared to conventional twin engine aircraft. The Velocity V Twin is unique as it will not stall with a single engine failure, instead the nose "bobbles" while the main wings remain stable, dramatically increasing flight time after engine failure. The prototype was first flown on 13 March 2012 and appeared at Sun 'n Fun the following month.
Minetta Creek was one of the largest natural watercourses in Manhattan, New York City, United States. Minetta Creek was fed from two tributaries, one originating at Fifth Avenue and 21st Street, and the other originating at Sixth Avenue and 16th Street. They joined near Fifth Avenue and 11th Street then took a southwesterly course. Minetta Creek's name is thought to have originated from either the Native American term "Manette", meaning "Devil's Water", or the Dutch word "Minnetje", meaning "the little one". Minetta Creek was originally known by the Dutch as Bestevaer's Killetje. During the 18th century, large amounts of wildlife could be seen around the creek. In the early 1820s, the New York City common council commissioned a project to divert Minetta Creek into a covered sewer. The creek was filled in by the mid 19th century, although it persisted as an underground stream through the 20th century. Ever since the creek was covered in the 19th century, there have been debates over whether the creek still exists. Minetta Creek caused flooding in basements and construction sites from the mid 19th century through the mid 20th century. Pools of water were also found at several construction sites along the creek's course. Course. Minetta Creek was one of Manhattan's largest natural waterways. Nearly long, Minetta Creek began from two tributaries, the main one having its source near Fifth Avenue and 21st Street, and a secondary one that had its source at Sixth Avenue and 16th Street. The streams flowed southward and joined within the block bound by 11th and 12th Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. From there it flowed southward across modern day Washington Square Park. It then crossed southwest along the present route of Minetta Lane, one of the creek's namesake streets. The creek then roughly followed the current path of Minetta Street, a one block road going south from Minetta Lane before curving southwest to meet Sixth Avenue. Minetta Creek then turned west along what is now Downing Street and eventually discharged into the Hudson River near Charlton Street. Origins of name. Minetta Creek is alternatively called Minetta Brook, Minetta Stream, Minetta Water, or Minetta Waters. It was also referred to by its Dutch name, Bestevaer's Killetje, before the American Revolutionary War. A plaque affixed to the building at Two Fifth Avenue provides one derivation of the "Minetta" name and reads as follows: Another theory is that the name is an Anglicization of the Dutch root "min" or "minuut" (English: little) and suffix " tje" to produce "Minnetje" or "The little one" to distinguish it from the Groot Kill, a large creek that was a mile away. However, 'min' in Dutch does not translate to 'little"; in modern Dutch, it translates to "minus" or "less". Colonial days. In the Dutch era, the area surrounding the creek was known as the Land of the Blacks and settled by freed Africans. A path along the creek, called the "Negroes' Causeway", later formed the hub of the Little Africa neighborhood and now follows part of the route of Minetta Street. The creek, whose course formed a well defined channel, was known for its abundance of fish, in particular trout. Pickerel, bass, and pike were among the species fished in it. "All manner of wild fowl" including ducks and geese could be found in the creek. In fact, the filling in had preceded real estate speculators' infill operations, according to the British Headquarters Map of 1782 1783. At the time, the British carried out extensive defenses of the city, and according to ecologist Eric W. Sanderson, "they dammed Minetta Water to create a lake in what is now the West Village". Bestevaer's Killetje formed a convenient landmark designation for surveyors. Murray Hoffman's "Treatise Upon the Estate and Rights of the Corporation of the City of New York, as Proprietors" reprints numerous historical documents from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a number of which mention Minetta Creek. Most of these pre nineteenth century documents refer to the creek by its Dutch name, "Bestavaer's Killtjie" (or, in a more probable spelling, "Bestevaer's Killetje"). One of the most significant of pre American Revolutionary War documents consolidating ownership of land in Manhattan was the Montgomerie Charter, named after governor John Montgomerie, dated January 15, 1730, and ratified by the Colonial Legislature in 1732. It stated in part: The Land Ordinance of 1796 a U.S. federal cadastral survey done for purposes of taxation, also reprinted by Hoffman laid out the line of West Street, which had been built over landfill. The survey took note of three particular locations. The first was a point north of Greenwich Street "from the center of the arch or bridge over Bestaver's Killtjie." Hoffman added a note: "Bestaver's Killtjie was afterward known as the Minetta Brook, and crossed Greenwich street in the vicinity of Charlton Street." He concluded his note by stating that this geographic point was represented in an 1807 map made by Charles Loss. A swamp area existed in what is now Washington Square Park, fed by the waters of Minetta Creek. The creek served as a boundary between a potter's field which was established on April 7, 1797, and was in operation until May 25, 1825, on its eastern bank, and private property to its west. The southernmost part of the creek's course was the estate known as Richmond Hill, originally created by Abraham Mortier in the late 1760s. In 1794, he leased it to Aaron Burr, who altered the course of the creek to form "Burr's Pond" at the foot of his estate. Covering. In 1896, Charles Haynes Haswell recalled an observation from eighty years earlier. Minetta Stream had been "fully apparent; and as it was and is of considerable volume, it has been [a] very important and expensive factor in the construction of the foundations along its line, from its main source, near the site of the Union Club, to its discharge in the North [i.e. Hudson] River." "In 1820 there still was a small colony of muskrats, bordering this creek," Issachar Cozzens recalled in 1843. "The brook passed along the lower end of Potter's Field, and formed a large pond called Bollus's Pond, where Downing Street now is; the low swampy grounds that were filled up caused this pond, which lay a little north west of Richmond Hill." The covering of Minetta Stream began in 1820, when the common council appointed James Wallace to build a Minetta sewer. Joan H. Geismar, an urban archaeologist who wrote an archaeological assessment of Washington Square Park in 2005, hypothesized that the purpose of this sewer was in part to function as a drain directing water away from the potter's field. Geismar surmised that the building of the sewer was not enough for the creek to avoid the cemetery because in 1823, the common council directed Thomas Cummings to deepen the riverbed of Minetta Creek. Due to the opening of Fifth Avenue, on December 10, 1824, the Council directed that Minetta Creek be culverted from its location at Fourth Street (now Washington Square South) to Sixth Street (now Washington Square North). With the closing of the potter's field on May 25, 1825, the council chose to transform the area into a military parade ground, which eventually became Washington Square Park. By autumn 1828, the creek was diverted to the Hudson River through a wooden sewer. By 1849, the Richmond Hill estate near the southern end of the stream had been demolished, with row houses taking its place, indicating that water no longer flowed through the area. The residential brownstone residence at 45 West Twelfth Street was built in 1846, with its eastern wall at an odd shape, slightly overlapping its neighbor at 43 West Twelfth Street (erected in 1861). This wall had been necessitated because the house was built on the bank of Minetta Creek. With increasing numbers of immigrants moving to the area during the latter half of the nineteenth century, several doctors were appointed by the New York State Legislature to investigate housing conditions in tenements, and they spent many days interrogating various residents. On October 27, 1884 they interrogated John F. Attridge, a real estate agent, on living conditions in various kinds of housing in lower Manhattan. At one point Doctor S. Oakley Vanderpoel raised the subject of whether houses built over filled in ground had proper drainage. To this Attridge responded: "I lived for fifteen years over Minetta Brook, and the people always considered it the most unhealthy place in New York, but there was nobody sick." In 1892, the "New York Times" reported the flooding of the cellar of Solomon Sayles, a merchant whose store was located at 126 Sixth Avenue, between Tenth and Eleventh Streets. This incident provided the "Times" reporter an opportunity to speak with Egbert Ludovicus Viele, who had designed the "Topographical &amp; Sanitary Map of Manhattan" published in 1865. Viele had first investigated the creek in 1860, using a British survey made at the time of the Revolutionary War. Viele explained that the creek was a source of water prior to construction of the Croton Distributing Reservoir. Once the reservoir had been completed in 1842, the creek was no longer needed as a water source, and it became a dumping ground. When Viele once gave a talk on the creek, an elderly physician in the audience recalled cases of intermittent fever due to the creek. Viele was quoted as saying "I have no doubt that the water in Mr. Sayles's cellar comes from the sources of Minetta Creek." He then described the source of Minetta Creek as a perennial spring. Viele concluded that because the springs were natural, dams could not be installed upon them. The 1892 article recommended better drainage for Manhattan's subterranean water sources. In his 1894 book, "In Old New York", Thomas A. Janvier wrote: "Although Manetta Creek no longer is visible on the surface, it still flows in diminished volume through its ancient channel as those living near or over it sometimes know to their cost." Janvier described the creek's path and warned that no buildings could be built on or near it without extensive reinforcements to their foundations. In addition to Sayles's store, he mentioned the recent floodings of the Lincoln Building at the southwest corner of Union Square, the building at the northeast corner of 19th Street and Fifth Avenue, and 66 Fifth Avenue. In 1897, George Everett Hill and George E. Waring Jr. wrote: "Although Minetta Brook has been lost to sight for many years, we have abundant evidence that it still exists. Deep excavations near its course are almost invariably flooded by its waters, and heavy buildings over or beside it require elaborate foundations of piling." Encounters with the creek underground. Encounters with Minetta Creek in the twentieth century were based on construction projects that unexpectedly encountered its water underground. In 1900, construction workers for the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&amp;M; today the PATH) had to navigate quicksand formed from the water. Their work was particularly difficult as they could not break the surface of Sixth Avenue, which would have disrupted traffic. The next year, Egbert Ludovicus Viele was again contacted concerning flooding in a construction project, and again declared the source of water to be Minetta Creek. In 1907, the Degnon Contracting Company was building the H&amp;M Railroad's Uptown Hudson Tubes north of Ninth Street and declared the water to have dried up, to the relief of area property owners who had previously spent thousands of dollars on pumps to rid their properties of water. This was again confirmed by a 1916 article. Subsequently, in 1928, the Independent Subway System's West Fourth Street Washington Square station (now part of the New York City Subway system) was built under the H&amp;M tunnels. A reporter for "The New York Times" indicated that the stream could be seen in the construction site. In 1929, workers at the construction site of Jefferson Market found their worksite filled with water. H. W. Lesh, the chief engineer of contractor Marcus Construction Company, attributed the source to Minetta Creek. A photograph of the site under construction shows a pool of water from the creek. In 1977, during construction on Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center, Crimmins Construction encountered water from Minetta Creek. Robert Crimmins reported that the water was "quite clean" and that it flows "through the ground quite rapidly." The construction of Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Studios, in 1968, had been delayed in part due to flooding attributed to Minetta Creek. In 2014, author Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah wrote about a visit to Electric Lady Studios in "The Believer", where she saw water from the creek "rushing clear and steady" through a hole in the studio's cellar. To this day, it is disputed whether Minetta Creek actually exists. Bloggers claim that the creek still exists, based on evidence of flooding in basements and cellars. Will Hunt, searching in 2011, could not find any evidence of subterranean water. In 2012, local news station WCBS TV ran a story about several people looking into a manhole on Sixth Avenue, along the creek's former route, where observers found water that "looked too clean for the city sewer". Steve Duncan, a historian and self described geographer, told WCBS about the presence of potholes on 12th and 13th streets near where the creek crossed these streets, as well as flooding in basements along the creek's route.
Sunnyside is a proposed railroad station of the Long Island Rail Road in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Queens, New York City. The station will be opened after the completion of the Grand Central Terminal East Side Access extension project, and will be within the City Terminal Zone. The projected area will be at Queens Boulevard and Skillman Avenue. History. In the late 19th century, the LIRR had another Sunnyside Station, which was built by their subsidiary Newtown and Flushing Railroad, better known as the "White Line." This short lived line was designed to compete with the Flushing and North Side Railroad in 1873. When the F&amp;NS was consolidated into the LIRR, along with the Central Railroad of Long Island and South Side Railroad of Long Island, the White Line was dissolved, along with the original Sunnyside station. Though no direct connection to other mass transit services are known, the nearest existing subway stations are at 33rd Street Rawson Street on the IRT Flushing Line (), Queensboro Plaza on the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Astoria Line (), and Queens Plaza on the IND Queens Boulevard Line (). Construction for the station would not be possible until after East Side Access's expected completion in December 2022, as the yard is currently being redeveloped.

Opium Nation: Child Brides, Drug Lords, and One Woman's Journey Through Afghanistan is a 2011 book by Fariba Nawa. The author travels throughout Afghanistan to talk with individuals part of the opium production in Afghanistan, centering on women's role in it. Generally, reviewers felt that the book succeeded in its portrayal of Afghan culture and the impact of the opium trade on Afghans. Synopsis. Born in Herat, Afghanistan, nine year old Nawa escaped in 1982 with her family during the Soviet Afghan War. Following 18 years of separation from her homeland, Nawa visits the country in 2000 after the Taliban's rise to power in an attempt to harmonize her American and Afghan identities. Fluent in the dialect Dari Persian, she finds that she has difficulty comprehending the speech of people in her hometown Herat because Iranian words and idioms have seeped into their language. She spends seven years in the country attempting to comprehend and write about its changes. In 2002, she moves to Kabul, serving as a journalist reporting on the War in Afghanistan that began in 2001. From 2002 to 2007, she researches opium production in Afghanistan for her book. In her first visit, she finds that her gorgeous childhood memories are obscured by bleak actualities. Taliban leaders have suppressed inhabitants' aesthetic and academic ambitions. Nawa discusses opium trafficking in Afghanistan, a trade she said is valued at $4 billion in the country and $65 billion outside it. 60% of Afghanistan's GDP comes from opium, of which two thirds is distilled into heroin, a more potent drug. Because the distillation requires cooking, the traffickers allow women to take part in it. A large number of women and their families are beholden to opium. About 10 25% of women and children are speculated to be addicted to the drug. Many families serve in the opium enterprise as "opium farmers, refiners, or smugglers". Nawa describes the story of Darya, a 12 year old opium bride in the Ghoryan district given by her father to a creditor 34 years her senior to liquidate his opium debts. The girl is initially resistant to the marriage, telling Nawa, "I do not want to go with this man. Can you please help me?" She ultimately concedes to her father's wishes and marries the smuggler who lives hours away. After several months of no contact between Darya and the family, her mother beseeches Nawa to search for her. Nawa attempts to find the child, saying, "I was immediately attracted to the young girl because she was a mystery and a victim who needed to be saved from barbaric traditions. I thought it was my job as an outsider from the West to rescue her." But ultimately, she must give up because of danger from the child's husband and because the search takes her to the Helmand Province, a perilous place. Nawa believes that Darya will save herself by standing up to her husband, escaping him, or discovering how to cope with her situation. She writes, "Darya offers hope for change. I will always want to know what happened to her, and perhaps someday I will." Nawa reveals the story of an uncle who kidnaps a six year old boy and his friend in Takhar Province, an attempt to coerce the boy's father to settle an opium debt. When the debt is not settled, the boy disappears and his friend's body is found after several days in a river. She discusses the positive economic impact the opium industry has had on some families. For one woman, poppy cultivation allowed her to buy a taxi for her son and a carpet frame for her daughter. Some newly affluent farmers use some of the wealth to improve the infrastructure of their neighborhoods. At the book's end, she reveals that she has married Naeem Mazizian, whom she had met at the Herat chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2005, he moves to Kabul. Following four years of companionship, they marry and have a daughter, Bonoo Zahra. Nawa dedicated the book to her daughter and her parents, Sayed Begum and Fazul Haq. Style. "Part personal memoir and part history", the book delves into the elements of Afghanistan society seldom seen or comprehended by outsiders. "The Canberra Times" reviewer Bron Sibree called the book a "unique, finely distilled, intense perspective" that was "surprisingly frank and intimate" because women confide in her beliefs they do not tell other people. The book is packed with numerous facts and numbers pertaining to the swell in the drug business. Sibree noted that the narrative is filled with accounts of Afghan history, particularly its traditions and its elegant, multifarious landscapes. Sibree opined that Nawa's intense depiction of the Afghanis, notably the women who are unflappable notwithstanding their adversity, are etched into the mind even after an extended period of time. Reception. "Kirkus Reviews" praised Nawa for deftly depicting the "tragic complexity of Afghan society and the sheer difficulty of life there". The reviewer found parts of the book's dialogue to be contrived but noted that Nawa's convincing narrative "clearly stems from in depth reporting in a risk laden environment". Novelist Khaled Hosseini, author of "The Kite Runner" and "A Thousand Splendid Suns" praised the book for having a "very engaging narrative" and being "[a]n insightful and informative look at the global challenge of Afghan drug trade". Writing for "The Sun Herald", author Lucy Sussex called the book "strong, informative reading". "Publishers Weekly" noted that Nawa "draws rich, complex portraits of subjects on both sides of the law". The review said the book is notable for its "depth, honesty, and commitment" to chronicling women's thoughts regarding their role in the drug trade, placing her life in jeopardy to collect the women's stories. Nawa, the review noted, "writes with passion about the history of her volatile homeland and with cautious optimism about its future". Kate Tuttle of "The Boston Globe" commended the book for its "detailed, sensitive reporting of individual people's stories" and the author for her "clear eyed reckoning with a country and a people who are beyond her help". Writing in "The Guardian", investigative journalist Pratap Chatterjee found that the book "reminds us that Afghanistan is not just a war, but a country of many ordinary yet unique people, kind and cruel, rich and poor". In February 2012, "Opium Nation" ranked seventh in the "independent" section of "The Newcastle Herald"s bestseller list.

Arnold stman (born December 24, 1939) is a Swedish conductor and music director. Early life. Born in Malm , Sweden, stman studied art history and musicology at Lund, Paris and Stockholm. As a musician, he concentrated on the piano and the harpsichord, being largely self taught. During his years as a researcher, he focused on the subject of early opera, bringing to light a number of theretofore unknown or little known baroque operas. stman was a teacher at the Operah gskolan i Stockholm (then called the "") in 1969. He was theatre and museum director at the Drottningholms Teatermuseum (later known as Sveriges Teatermuseum) in Stockholm starting in 1979. Conducting career. stman was artistic director and conductor of the Vadstena Akademien from 1971until 1981, while also serving as conductor and artistic director of the NorrlandsOperan in Ume from 1974 until 1978. He was made artistic director of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre in 1980 and remained in that role until 1992. He gained an international reputation as a champion of the period performance movement in classical music, a movement that insists on the performance of repertoire from c. 1600 to 1820 (i.e., baroque, classical, and early romantic) using instruments (or modern replicas), techniques, and stylistic sensibilities from the appropriate period. In particular, Drottningholm's productions of Mozart operas with period instruments caused a considerable stir in the early days of the historical performance movement. To stman, use of historically appropriate instruments is vital to developing an understanding of the Mozartian style: It's so important to use classical instruments. We make mistakes with them, but we keep trying because it is really important complementary information, which has a scientific value. Yet we don't use it as Scientists, we use it for artistic freedom. The more information you have, the more freedom you have. Outside Sweden, stman has conducted a wide range of repertoire at the opera houses of Covent Garden, Vienna, Parma, Trieste, Cologne, Bonn, Toulouse, Nice, Wexford, Madrid, Washington, Lausanne, Paris (Garnier and Bastille) and at the Schwetzingen and Vienna Festivals, among others. As a symphonic conductor, stman has worked with many major European orchestras, including the German radio orchestras in Hamburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Stuttgart and Baden Baden; the G rzenich Orchestra Cologne; the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra; the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France; the Orchestre National de France; the Academy of Ancient Music; the Geneva Chamber Orchestra; the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Netherlands' Radio Chamber Orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Gothenburg Symphony, the Oslo Philharmonic, the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmoniker Hamburg. Awards and recognition. Arnold stman was awarded the newspaper "Expressen"'s Spelmannen in 1974. He was awarded an honorary doctorate at Ume University in 1979 and he is a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He was awarded the Litteris et Artibus 1990 and was elected to the Kungl.

Ivan C. Karp (June 4, 1926 June 28, 2012) was an American art dealer, gallerist and author instrumental in the emergence of pop art and the development of Manhattan's SoHo gallery district in the 1960s. Life. Ivan Karp was born in the Bronx and grew up in Brooklyn. His career in art began in 1955, when he served as the first art critic of the Village Voice. In 1956, he joined the Hansa Gallery, a downtown artists' cooperative gallery that had moved uptown to Central Park South. Karp was co director, alongside Richard Bellamy, who later founded the Green Gallery. He moved to the relatively new Leo Castelli Gallery in 1959 as associate director. While there, he helped sell the works of, popularize and market the initial generation of Pop artists, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg. On April 25, 1966 in Newsweek Magazine, Ivan Karp is described as the "Sol Hurok of Pop Art". He said he was devoted to this art form because the artists "transform banal objects. They see beauty in all things". Karp worked with Castelli for ten years, leaving in 1969 to open the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo, Manhattan. Karp's was the second art gallery to open on West Broadway, which ultimately became the core of the SoHo gallery district. His initial focus at O.K. Harris was on Photorealism, with artists such as Robert Cottingham and Robert Bechtle. Other artists represented by the gallery included Deborah Butterfield, Malcolm Morley and Duane Hanson. In the early 1960s, Karp led efforts to salvage architectural ornament from older New York City buildings that were being demolished for new construction. He founded the Anonymous Arts Recovery Society and often drove around the streets of Manhattan and the Bronx spotting and collecting materials from building sites before they could be carted away as rubble. Many of the hundreds of items recovered by Karp and his colleagues were deposited in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, displayed in the sculpture garden and the subway station adjacent to the museum. The Brooklyn Museum transferred 1500 architectural artifacts to the National Building Arts Center, located in Sauget, Illinois. Others are housed in the Anonymous Arts Museum Karp founded in Charlotteville, New York. Karp wrote a 1965 comic novel, "Doobie Doo", about love among pop artists with cover art by Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. He died on June 28, 2012 at the age of 86, in Charlotteville, New York.

Don Nygord (June 13, 1936 in Pocatello, Idaho December 26, 2004 in Prescott, Arizona) was an American sport shooter who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the 1988 Summer Olympics. Don Nygord grew up in eastern Oregon, where informal shooting was very common pursuit. He had guns of his own from the time he was 12 years old. He originally tried his hand at both fencing, and wrestling, but felt that neither sport was particularly a good fit for him. He attended Oregon State University, and then enlisted in the United States Air Force. It was based on a challenge to prove he could "shoot a bottle cap off a rock at 25 paces" by one of the members of the Mather AFB pistol team that Don got his start in competition. The challenge of the bullseye discipline captured his attention, and so began what would be a lifelong study of the art. After several years of competing, Don won the Civilian National Championship at the NRA Nationals in 1966 at Camp Perry, Ohio. At the time he was working in the Aerospace industry with Union Carbide's Specialty Metals Division in Indiana. A local shooter there introduced him to the UIT (now ISSF) courses of fire. Air Pistol and Free Pistol were real eye openers, and Don found these particularly challenging, compared to the conventional styles he been participating in. After shooting some of these types of matches locally, he did very well, and received his first invitations to attend the tryouts for the US Shooting Team. However, due to work and personal constraints, he didn't attended until 1978. That year, he went to Phoenix for the UIT Nationals, placed third in Air Pistol, and found himself on the US National Team. When told that the team would soon be traveling to shoot a match in Mexico, Don wanted to know how much it would cost him for the trip. Naive as he was regarding travel allowances, Don certainly proved his worth on the international stage, and found his way to the podium in no time. In 1979, Don knew he would win the National Air Pistol Championship "before I pulled out of the driveway to go to the match. And he did just that. Later that same year, the team went to the Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, where he won the Gold Medals for individual and team in Air Pistol. Following this success, he left the aerospace field for good, and started a business of supplying and customizing target guns and accessories so he could meet the US Team's demands for travel and competitions. Don would soon go on to win the World Championship in Santo Domingo in 1981, shooting a near World Record on a windy outdoor range. In the coming years, Don was a perennial member of the US National Team for decades, a National Champion 16 times, won more medals during his tenure than any other shooter in US history, was a member of the 1984 and 1988 US Olympic Teams where he was the oldest US Olympian. He was the former holder of the US Free Pistol record (his score of 574 stood for over a decade), and held over 40 other National Records. As a competitor Don developed several important equipment advances, including the FWB Model 65 Mk II (with its shortened barrel), and his own "TurboComp" muzzle compensator, which was used on earlier generations of high end target air pistols, until the manufacturers started producing their own compensated barrels. He was the US importer for many different quality competition firearms and air guns over the years through his company "Nygord Precision Products," and offered pellets and accessories to shooting enthusiast as well.

Arachnoid as a descriptive term in botany, refers to organs such as leaves or stems that have an external appearance similar to cobwebs from being covered with fine white hairs, usually tangled. Such material is one common cause of plants having a grey or white appearance. The usages of various authors in distinguishing between "arachnoid" and a few other terms referring to hairiness, such as floccose, pubescent, tomentum, cottony, or villous, tend to be arbitrary, but as a rule the term is best reserved for hairiness lighter than a felted layer, and inclined to rub off or to be easily damaged in other ways. The arachnoid appearance is common on the leaves and stems of various sclerophyllous members of the Asteraceae, such as some thistles. Nonetheless, "cobwebbiness" is a subjective impression, and in the likes of "Hayworthia arachnoidea" the arachnoid impression arises from the thicket of spinescent leaf denticles that are not at all fine, tangled, or fragile. In the cactus "Cephalocereus senilis", the arachnoid effect arises from long lasting hairy spines.

Hendershot is a surname. Hendershot is the Americanized version of Hinneschied (could also be Hinderschied or Hinterschied). Hinneschied is believed to come from the surname Hayderschatte. Hayderschatte came from Micheal Hayder and Charlotte Schatte. When they had been married, they combined last names and therefore created the surname Hayderschatte. Shortly after however, it is believed that their son, Wilhelm, had changed it to Hinneschied. Before the Hendershot's came to America, they had lived in the Rhineland Palatinate, Germany. The original farmhouse that the German Hinneschieds lived in is still up and standing today. The first Hinneschied/Hendershot to come to America, Johann Micheal Hendershot, had brought his family and himself to Tewksbury Township, New Jersey, on June 13, 1710. The Hendershot house (Hohenhaus meaning 'High House') in Tewksbury Township, New Jersey, is also still standing. It is believed that all Hendershot's in the United States and North America can trace their genealogy back to Johann and his family. As of May 2021, there are 7,409 people with the surname Hendershot. This makes it the 5369th most popular last name. The Hendershot's span all across America mostly found in states like Ohio, Virginia, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Notable people with the surname include. Fictional characters:

Alexander Alexandrovich Glagolev (Russian: ; 14 February 1872 25 November 1937) was a Russian Orthodox priest and religious philosopher as well as professor of the Kiev Theological Seminary. Biography. Alexander Glagolev was born to a priestly family. He graduated from the Tula theological seminary (1894) and the Kiev theological seminary (1898) with a doctoral degree in theology. His thesis was called "Angels in the Old Testament". In the review of his thesis, professor Olesnitsky noted that: "Glagolev's dissertation has both breadth and depth of research covering all points in the Old Testament angelology... and should be considered a real contribution to our theological literature which has not had until now a serious study in angelology". Alexander Men writes in the article on Glagolev in his "Bibliological" Dictionary (2002): Glagolev in his dissertation gave an overview of the history of ange[l]ology and analysed all names of angels in the Old Testament... His work also contains the history of biblical demonology. The author did not possess our modern scientific knowledge about the history of religions of [the] ancient East, but he introduced a number of interesting considerations sometimes preempting the conclusions of modern biblical studies." Glagolev and the Jews in Kiev. In 1905, Glagolev acted against the Jewish pogrom in Kiev. The Russian American journal "Russkij Globus" describes it as follows: During the cruel autumn of 1905 in the buzz of pogroms and murder[,] people poured out on the streets again. A small procession meddles into the outraged human crowd wearing complete priestly vestments, carrying crosses and church banners. It is headed by the Russian priests Alexander Glagolev and Mikhail Edlinsky. Across Kontraktova Square and Gostinniy Riad the procession moves towards the Jewish shops. They admonish the crowd not to participate in this evil, unchristian act. Some people recognize their spiritual leaders and take off their hats out of respect. The crowd starts hesitating, wobbling, gets thinner and gradually breaks up. And this happened more than once. In 1909, Glagolev published an article "The Old Testament and Its Eternal Significance in Christianity" in which he expressed some sharp criticism of some antisemitic authors trying to discredit the Old Testament. Glagolev was a key expert witness for the defense during the 1913 trial of Menahem Mendel Beilis. At the trial he gave expert evidence against the idea that Jews used blood in their religious rituals. He stated during this trial that Mosaic laws from the Old Testament strictly forbid shedding human blood and using it to prepare food. The Talmud and other Jewish rabbinical laws confirm this prohibition. Specifically, he affirmed that "the Law of Moses forbids spilling human blood and using any blood in general in food." His statement went against the ritual murder accusation, upon which the whole case was constructed. The evidence provided by the Russian Orthodox priest and established religious philosopher was instrumental in convincing the solely Russian Christian jury that Beilis was innocent. In addition to direct interventions against pogroms and his testimony at the Beilis trial, there were multiple recollections of Glagolev helping the poor and needy population of Kiev, both Jewish and Muslim. Family. Aleksander Glagolev was the father of Alexey Alexandrovich Glagolev, who saved Jews in Kiev during the Second World War and later became one of the Righteous among the Nations. Last days and death. On 20 October 1937, Alexander Glagolev was arrested by the NKVD. He was tortured and died in prison on 25 November 1937.

Four referendums were held in Switzerland during 1935. The first was held on 24 February on a federal law reorganising the military, and was approved by voters. The second was held on 5 May on a federal law on the transport of goods and animals on roads, and was rejected by two thirds of voters. The third was held on 2 June on a popular initiative "to combat the economic crisis" and was also rejected by voters. The fourth was held on 8 September on a popular initiative "for a total revision of the federal constitution", and was rejected by 72% of voters. Background. The June referendum on the popular initiative "to combat the economic crisis" was a mandatory referendum, requiring a double majority; a majority of the popular vote and majority of the cantons. The decision of each canton was based on the vote in that canton. Full cantons counted as one vote, whilst half cantons counted as half. The February and March referendums were "optional", whilst the September referendum was a "process initiating decision", both of which required only a majority of the public vote.

Carl Alpert (; May 12, 1913 May 12, 2005) was a Boston born journalist, author, communal worker and public relations specialist, first in America and then in Israel (where he settled in 1952 after making Aliyah). He died on his 92nd birthday, which was also Israel Independence Day. His first newspaper article appeared on April 25, 1930, and his last was dated March 14, 2005. His syndicated articles appeared in Denver's "Intermountain Jewish News" over the course of 67 years. From the time he wrote his first column in "The Jewish Advocate" of Boston in 1937 to his termination of his syndicated column in 2005 due to ill health, he calculated that he had written some 3,300 columns. In 1997, he was self syndicated in close to 50 Jewish newspapers worldwide, and in 2005 he had a mailing list of some 100 recipients (mainly serials). Life. Alpert was born to Max L. Alpert and Flora Effross in Boston; the Jewish couple also had a daughter, Marcia and a son, Sumner. Alpert began his career serving as a copywriter at the Bay State Mailing Service in Boston in 1930, becoming a reporter at the city's "Jewish Advocate" newspaper in 1932 and then its editor from 1935 40. During that time he attended Boston University (1931 35). He became a devoted Zionist in 1927 as a result of his connection with Young Judaea. All my information and early education about Zionism came from Young Judaea. I threw myself wholeheartedly into the movement and began to read and study voraciously everything I found on the Zionist movement, he recalled in later years. Alpert was the director of the Young Judaean Clubs (1934 36), becoming president of the movement's New England region in 1937 and president of the movement itself in 1940. In that year he became managing editor of the "New Palestine", published by the Zionist Organization of America. His work at the "New Palestine" was interrupted when he was inducted into the US Army as a private in 1943. He served in the military until 1946 and then returned to his work at "New Palestine". In 1946 he became director of the Department of Education of the Zionist Organization of America. He moved to Israel in 1952, working as the director of public relations (1952 5) and later assistant to the president at the Technion. He retired in 1983, at which time he was executive vice chairman of the Board of Governors at the Technion. In 1940, Alpert married Natalie (Nechama) Tennenbaum of Cincinnati, whom he had met at Young Judaea. The couple, married for 64 years, had three children. Journalism career. Alpert's career as a Jewish journalist lasted nearly 75 years. Among such Jewish journalists with long careers were Nechemia Meyers (1930 2009), an American who was a public relations specialist for 32 years and a journalist in Israel for at least 25 years, and was a syndicated writer; the English born Julian L. Meltzer (1904 77), who spent 51 years writing for publications in Palestine and elsewhere; Boris Smolar (1897 1986), a Ukraine born American reporter and editor in Europe and elsewhere for more than 60 years; Julius Hayman (1907 2000), publisher for 63 years of "The Jewish Standard" (Toronto); Philip Slomovitz (1896 1993), regarded as the dean of Jewish journalists, a newspaperman in Detroit for 71 years; Violet Spevack, who wrote, over a period of nearly 50 years, some 2,500 columns in the "Cleveland Jewish News"; and Gabriel Murrel Cohen (1908 2007), who founded the "National Jewish Post &amp; Opinion" in Indianapolis in 1935 and continued editing it until close to his death. From the beginning of his career, Alpert was recognized as one of the hardest working Anglo Jewish editors in the profession. On several occasions he took on controversial subjects in the media, including responses to a widely discussed 1949 "Commentary" article by Isaac Rosenfeld and to a 1951 "The New York Times" editorial which faulted President Harry Truman for recognizing Israel. Alpert maintained a Jewish reference file of more than 75,000 clippings. From his sunny perch high on the slopes of Haifa's Mount Carmel, stated an editorial in the "Intermountain Jewish News", Alpert observed Israel with the unusual combination of a sage's wisdom and a child's wonder ... Israel never ceased to amaze and fascinate him, even when it frustrated and saddened. He excelled at sharing those paradoxes. An Alpert column followed a pattern, stated another editor, the presentation of an interesting personality or issue, followed by a description of various points of view on the subject. Columns were always informatively researched, often containing little known information Finally, the reader would often be left with a question or two to ponder.

Hugh de Burgh (died 1352) was a Crown official and judge in fourteenth century Ireland, who held the offices of Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was praised for his good service to the English Crown, but was also accused of maladministration. Although he is said to have been born in England, he was a member of the leading Anglo Irish de Burgh dynasty; he was a cousin of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, and later acted as attorney for the Earl's daughter and heiress Elizabeth, Duchess of Clarence. Her mother, Maud of Lancaster, who was second cousin to King Edward III, used her considerable influence at Court on Hugh's behalf. Despite the later complaints about his misconduct, he was a professional lawyer, and as such he was better qualified for appointment to the Bench than some of his colleagues: the Barons of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in that era were often accused of being deficient in their knowledge of the law. As was then usual when seeking appointment to the Bench, he took holy orders. He was in the service of the Crown in 1331, when he came to Ireland. He later became the Irish attorney to Queen Philippa of Hainault. In 1335 he became third Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). In 1337 he was continued in office for four years, in consideration of his past good service to the Crown, and shortly after became Chief Baron. He was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland in 1339 and Lord Treasurer in 1340. He was reappointed Chief Baron in 1344. In 1347 he was accused of misconduct, and a commission of oyer and terminer was set up to inquire into his "oppression". Precisely what form the alleged oppression (a term which has no precise modern equivalent) took is unclear. Similar charges against his successor John de Burnham were concerned with fraud and financial mismanagement, and it seems that the Privy Council of Ireland had some doubts about de Burgh's honesty. The complaints against him formed part of a wider pattern of general dissatisfaction with the King's Irish royal servants, and as a result the commission's remit was soon extended into an examination of official wrongdoing generally. John de Burnham, an English Crown official with long experience of financial administration, was sent to Ireland as Treasurer to reform de Burgh's alleged abuses, only to spend much of his career fighting similar charges of corruption. In 1348 de Burgh went to England to plead his case; presumably he made a convincing defence of his actions, since he received a royal pardon. He returned to Ireland, and remained Chief Baron until 1351; he died a year later.

Metro Manila is divided into seventeen primary local government units (LGU) that consist of sixteen cities and one municipality. Each city and municipality is governed by an elected mayor and is divided into several villages or barangays (formerly called barrios) headed by an elected barangay captain. Barangay populations range in size from under 1,000 to over 200,000. As of the 2015 census, the total population of Metro Manila was 12,877,253. Among all local government units in Metro Manila, only the cities of Manila, Caloocan and Pasay implement the Zone Systems. A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a chairman for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections. The zoning system is merely for strategical purposes. Additionally, these three cities use a hybrid system for its barangays all barangays have their corresponding numbers but only a few have corresponding names. For example, the name of a barangay in the City of Manila would read as "Barangay 288 Zone 27". As of 2015, there are 1,710 barangays in Metro Manila. These original four cities of Metro Manila (Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay) comprise 83% (1,428 of 1,710) of all these. The high number is attributed to these areas having more people and higher density when the barangay system was initiated (note that Caloocan North is sparsely populated then and consequently was given a lower number of barangays). The other cities merely converted old barrios to barangays. In 1975, Manila had 1,479,116 people (897 barangays), Quezon City with 956,864 (142 barangays), Caloocan with 397,201 (188 barangays) and Pasay with 254,999 (201 barangays). Due to population growth especially in the suburbs of Manila, the number of barangays now seem disproportionate. More than half of barangays in Metro Manila are found in the City of Manila (2015 "pop.": 1,780,148) with 897 barangays. Caloocan ("pop.": 1,583,978) has 188 barangays and Pasay ("pop.": 416,522) has 210 barangays. In comparison, Quezon City (2015 "pop.": 2,936,116)the largest city both in terms of land area and populationonly has 142 barangays. The number of barangays in other local government units in Metro Manila range from 9 in Muntinlupa to 33 in Makati and Valenzuela. In 1989, Republic Act 6714 called for a plebiscite reducing the seventy barangays constituting the first congressional district of Caloocan to only thirty barangays. Manila has also attempted to bring down the number of barangays from 897 to 150 in 1996 through Ordinance 7907 but failed to hold a plebiscite. This list covers all barangays sorted alphabetically with the exception of Manila, Caloocan and Pasay. Instead, district names are listed for these cities.

Nicola Petrina (13 November 1861 11 January 1909) was an Italian socialist and politician from Sicily. He was one of the national leaders of the Fasci Siciliani (Sicilian Leagues) a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891 1894. Life. Together with the anarchist Giovanni No , he set up the first "Fascio dei Lavoratori" in Messina on 18 March 1889, but the organisation remained dormant after the arrest of Petrina in July of that year. He was not released until 1892 when many more Fasci had been set up in Sicily. Another reason why the "Fascio" of Messina formed after the example of the "Fasci operai" [Workers leagues] constituted in Central and North Italy from 1871 initially did not develop was that it brought together not individual workers but the workers' associations of the city, which retained their independence, their status and economic orientation. Petrina was among the 500 delegates from nearly 90 leagues and socialist circles at the Congress of the Fasci that was held in Palermo on 21 22 May 1893. A Central Committee was elected, composed of nine members: Petrina was elected for the province of Messina. The Congress decided that all Leagues were obliged to join the Party of Italian Workers ("Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani", the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party). In July 1893, he was elected in the municipal council of Messina, where he immediately discovered serious abuses that had been committed in the City Hall for years. Following the repression of the Fasci Siciliani by the government of Francesco Crispi, he was arrested on 4 January 1894, and was brought to trial. On May 30, 1894, the leaders of the movement received their sentence: Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida to 18 years and Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Nicola Barbato and Bernardino Verro to 12 years in jail. Petrina was sentenced to three years, on trumped up charges and his contact with the anarchist Amilcare Cipriani. He died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami of 28 December 1908, when the city of Messina was almost entirely destroyed killing between 75,000 and 82,000 people. His body was found on 11 January 11 1909.

The Chamber of Peers () was the upper house of the French parliament from 1814 to 1848. History. The Peerage of France was recreated by the Charter of 1814 at the same time as the Bourbon Restoration, albeit on a different basis from that of the ancien regime before 1789. A new Chamber of Peers was created which was similar to the British House of Lords, and it met at the Palais du Luxembourg. This new Chamber of Peers acted as the Upper House of the French parliament. Like the House of Lords, the Chamber of Peers also had a judicial function, being authorized to judge peers and other prominent people. As such, it sentenced Marshal Ney to death. To begin with it had 154 members, including the holders of all surviving pre Revolutionary ecclesiastical (Reims, Langres, and Ch lons) and lay peerages, except for the Duchy of Aubigny, which was held by a foreigner, the British Duke of Richmond. Thirteen peers were also prelates. New members were appointed by the king, without limit on their numbers. Such a peerage was either granted for life or was heritable, at the king's will. All men of the royal family and all descendants in the male line of previous kings ("princes du sang") were members of the chamber by birth ("pairs n s"), but nevertheless needed explicit permission from the king to sit at each session of the chamber. At the outset comprising only hereditary peers and certain prelates of the church, the Chamber became a body to which men were appointed for life following the July Revolution of 1830. In the Revolution of 1848, the Chamber of Peers was disbanded and the peerage of France was abolished.

De Hirsh Margules (1899 1965) was a Romanian American "abstract realist" painter who crossed paths with many major American artistic and intellectual figures of the first half of the 20th century. Elaine de Kooning said that he was "[w]idely recognized as one of the most gifted and erudite watercolorists in the country"."The New York Times" critic Howard Devree stated in 1938 that "Margules uses color in a breath taking manner. A keen observer, he eliminates scrupulously without distortion of his material." Devree later called Margules "one of our most daring experimentalists in the medium"" Margules was also a well known participant in the bohemian culture of New York City's Greenwich Village, where he was widely known as the "Baron" of Greenwich Village. The New York Times described him as "one of Greenwich Village's best known personalities" and "one of the best known and most buoyant characters about Greenwich Village." Early life. De Hirsh Margules was born in 1899 in the Romanian city of Ia i (also known as Iasse, Jassy, or Jasse). When Margules was 10 weeks old, his family immigrated to New York City. Both of his parents were active in the Yiddish theater, His father was Yekutiel "Edward" Margules, a "renowned Jewish actor impresario and founder of the Yiddish stage." Margules' mother, Rosa, thirty nine years younger than his father, was an actress in the Yiddish theater and later in vaudeville. Although Margules appeared as a child actor with the Adler Family and Bertha Kalich, his sister, Annette Margules, somewhat dubiously continued in family theater and vaudeville tradition, creating the blackface role of the lightly clad Tondelayo (a part later played on film Hedy Lamarr) in Earl Carroll's 1924 Broadway exoticist hit, White Cargo. (Annette herself faced stereotyping as an exotic flower: writing about her publicist Charles Bouchert stated that "Romania produces a stormy, temperamental type of woman a type admirably fitted to portray emotion.") His brother Samuel became a noted magician who appeared under the name "Rami Sami." Samuel later became a lawyer, representing magician Horace Goldin, among others. A family portrait including a young De Hirsh, a portrait of Rosa and Annette together, and individual photos of Rosa and Edward can be found on the Museum of the City of New York website. At around age 9 or 10, Margules took art classes with the Boys Club on East Tenth Street, and his first taste of exhibition was at a student art show presented by the club. By age 11, he had won a city wide prize (a box camera) at a children's art show presented by the department store Wanamakers. As a young teenager, Margules was already displaying a characteristic kindness and loyalty. Upon hearing that two friends (one of them was author Alexander King), were in trouble for breaking a school microscope, the nearly broke Margules gave them five dollars to repair the microscope . Margules had to approach a wealthy man that Margules had once saved on the subway from a heart attack. Margules didn't reveal the source of the five dollars to King until twenty five years later. In his late teens, Margules studied for a couple of months in Pittsburgh with Edwin Randby, a follower of Western painter Frederic Remington. Thereafter he pursued a two year course of studies in architecture, design and decoration at the New York Evening School of Art and Design, while working as a clerk during the day at Stern's Department Store. He was encouraged in these artistic pursuits by his neighbor, the painter Benno Greenstein (who later went by the name of Benjamin Benno). Artistic career. In 1922, Margules began work as a police reporter for the City News Association of New York . Margules then considered himself something of an expert on art, and the painter Myron Lechay is said to have responded to some unsolicited analysis of his work with the remark "Since you seem to know so much about it, why don't you paint yourself?" This led to study with Lechay and a flurry of painting. Margules' first show was in 1922 at Jane Heap's Little Review Gallery. Thereafter Margules began to participate in shows with a group including Stuart Davis, Jan Matulka, Buckminster Fuller (exhibiting depictions of his "Dymaxion house") in a gallery run by art lover and restaurateur Romany Marie on the floor above her cafe. During the 1920s, Margules traveled outside of the country a number of times. In 1922, with the intent of reaching Bali, he took a job as a "'wiper on a tramp steamer where [he] played nursemaid to the engine." He reached Rotterdam before he turned back. He would return to Rotterdam shortly thereafter. In 1927, Margules took a lengthy leave of absence from his day job as a police reporter in order to travel to Paris, where he "set up a studio in Montmartre's Place du Tertre, on the top floor of an almost deserted hotel, a shabby establishment, lacking both heat and running water." He studied at the Louvre and traveled to paint landscapes in provincial France and North Africa. Margules also joined the "Noctambulist" movement and experimented with painting and showing his artwork in low light. Jonathan Cott wrote that: the painter De Hirsch Margulies sat on the quays of the Seine and painted pictures in the dark. In fact, the first exhibition of these paintings, which could be seen only in a darkened room, took place in [ Walter Lowenfels'] Paris apartment. Elaine de Kooning remarked that studying the works of the Noctambulists confirmed Margules' "direction toward the use of primary colors for perverse effects of heavy shadow." It was also in Paris that Margules initially conceived his idea of "Time Painting", where a painting is divided into sectors, each representing a different time of day, with color choices meant to evoke that time of day. In Paris, his social circle included Lowenfels, photographer Berenice Abbott, publisher Jane Heap, composer George Anthiel, sculptor Thelma Wood, painter Andr Favory, writer Norman Douglas, writer and editor George Davis, composer and writer Max Ewing, and writer Michael Fraenkel. Upon his return to New York in 1929, Margules attended an exhibition of John Marin's paintings. While at the exhibition, he "launched into an eloquent explanation of Marin to two nearby women", and was overheard by an impressed Alfred Stieglitz. The photographer and art promoter invited Margules to dine with his wife, the artist Georgia O'Keeffe, and his assistant, painter Emil Zoler. Stieglitz thereafter became a friend and mentor to Margules, becoming for him "what Socrates was to his friends." Stieglitz introduced Margules to John Marin, who quickly became the most important painterly influence upon Margules. Elaine de Kooning later noted that Margules was "[i]ndebted to Marin and through Marin to C zanne for his initial conceptual approach for his constructions of scenes with no negative elements, for skies that loom with the impact of mountains." Margules himself said that Marin was his "father and ... academy." The admiration was by no means unreciprocated: Marin said that Margules was "an art lover with abounding faith and sincerity, with much intelligence and quick seeing." Stieglitz also introduced Margules to many other artistic and intellectual figures in New York. With the encouragement of Alfred Stieglitz, Margules in 1936 opened a two room gallery at 43 West 8th Street called "Another Place." Over the following two years there were fourteen solo exhibitions by Margules and others, and the gallery was well respected by the press. It was in this gallery that the painter James Lechay, Myron's brother, exhibited his first painting. In 1936, Margules first saw recognition by major art museums when both the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston purchased his works. In 1942, Margules gave up working as a police reporter, and apparently dedicated himself thereafter solely to an artistic vocation. "The Baron of Greenwich Village". Margules made his mark not only as an artist, but also as an outsized personality known throughout Greenwich Village and beyond. To local residents, Margules was known as the "Baron", after Baron Maurice de Hirsch, a prominent German Jewish philanthropist. Margules was easily recognizable by the beret he routinely wore over his long hair. Writer Charles Norman said that he "dressed with a flair for sloppiness." He was said to "know everybody" in Greenwich Village, to the extent that when the novelist and poet Maxwell Bodenheim was murdered, Margules was the first one the police sought to identify the body. Margules' letters show him interacting with art world figures such as Sacha Kolin, John Marin and Alfred Stieglitz, as well as with prominent figures outside the art world such as polymath Buckminster Fuller and writer Henry Miller. Most of his friends and acquaintances found Margules a generous and voluble man, given to broadly emotionally expressive gestures and acts of kindness and loyalty. In 1929, he exhibited an example of this loyalty and fellow feeling when he appeared in court to fight what the wrongful commitment of his friend, writer and sculptor Alfred Dreyfuss, who appeared to have been a victim of an illicit attempt to block an inheritance. The Greenwich Village chronicler Charles Norman described the bone crushing hugs that Margules would routinely bestow on his friends and acquaintances, and speaks of the "persuasive theatricality" that Margules seemed to have inherited from his actor parents. Norman also wrote about Margules' routine acts of kindness, taking in homeless artists, constantly feeding his friends and providing the salvatory loan where needed. Norman also notes that Margules was blessed with a loud and good voice, and was apt to sing an operatic air without provocation. The writer and television personality Alexander King said I think the outstanding characteristics of my friend's personality are affirmation, emphasis, and overemphasis. He chooses to express himself predominantly in superlatives and the gestures which accompany his utterances are sometimes dangerous to life and limb. Of the bystanders, I mean. King also spoke with affectionate amusement about Margules' pride in his cooking, speaking of how "if he should ever invite you to dinner, he may serve you a hamburger with onions, in his kitchen living room, with such an air of gastronomic protocol, such mysterious hints and ogliing innuendoes, as if C sar Ritz and Brillat Savarin had sneaked out, only a moment before, with his secret recipe in their pockets." Margules was such a memorable New York personality that comic book writer Alvin Schwartz imagined him at the Sixth Avenue Cafeteria in a risible yet poignant debate with Clark Kent about whether Superman had the ability to stop Hitler. Margules' entrenchment in the Greenwich Village milieu can be seen in a photograph from Fred McDarrah's "Beat Generation Album" of a January 13, 1961 writers' and poets' meeting to discuss "The Funeral of the Beat Generation", in 's railroad flat at 85 Christopher Street. Among the people in the same photograph are Shel Silverstein, Lester Blackiston, James Baldwin, Norman Mailer, beat poet Howard Hart, and Ted Joans. Incidentally, Hart mentioned Margules in his poem "Thelonius Monk," referring to the "thin wood rocking chair De Hirsch Margules's weight / Had busted Bless him now and forever." More photos of Margules can be seen on the Smithsonian's "Archives of American Art" website, which has three photos which capture Margules' innate theatricality. One of them shows Margules (wearing his customary beret) jumping with child like glee in a New York City Park, surrounded by a flurry of pigeons. Another shows Margules in his studio, brush in hand, posing in front of one of his paintings. A third. also taken in a New York City park, shows Margules in a display of mock pomp, his hand inside his shirt a la Napoleon Bonaparte. Death. Among the three articles "The New York Times" dedicated to Margules' death was a mournful paean to lost Greenwich Village life written by Bernard Weinraub: "The Baron was De Hirsh Margules, painter, poet and newspaper reporter. He was remembered yesterday, on his burial, with the same gusto that marked his life in the Village." Maurice, the self styled "Prince of Bohemia" of Greenwich Village, remarked that Once there were so many genuine Bohemians in the Village. But now, so few oldtimers are left. Jake Spencer and Earl Kirkham and Harrison Doud are gone all gone. And now the Baron. Artist Leslie Jencel was quoted as saying I'm wearing my black leather cape today because De Hirsh would have wanted me to. He had such a sense of drama, of color. He had such a spirit of youth and creativity a rare and wise and unusual man. Another artist, Aristodimos Kaldis, said He was one of the last of the true Villagers. We used to go to the old Waldorf Cafeteria on Sixth Avenue and debate esthetics whether Rembrandt was the master of light, or El Greco or Tintoretto. We used to debate all night. Now of course, those days are gone. Margules' sister, actress Annette Margules, remembered him as charitable and generous to all who needed help. He took care of people, he even fed people. Why, last night, people came up to me and said, 'How am I going to eat now that De Hirsh is gone? The supposedly penniless Margules left an estate of more than $100,000, the amount and circumstances of which were enough to merit a "The New York Times" article and a mention by nationally syndicated celebrity columnist Leonard Lyons, who remarked the big shock to Greenwich Village's Bohemian colony last week was in learning that the Bohemian painter, de Hirsch Margolis [sic], left a huge estate. He was a stock market wizard. Among the forty five people sharing in his estate were "beneficiaries living in such diverse areas as Greenwich Village, Paris, Niagara Falls, Oyster Bay, and the Lower East Side of Manhattan."

A Hay Lot is a portion of common land used for haymaking and assigned by lot or allotment. Traditionally a marker, usually of stone, was used in early agriculture to mark the position of an individual hay lot within a hay meadow. The marker stone would typically bear the initials of the lot holder. Such markers would have been common place in meadows in Britain, but with the advent of modern farming many hay meadows were ploughed for arable crops, and the hay lots removed. Today, few such examples remain, but some can be seen in the North Meadow at Cricklade. In modern agriculture a Hay lot is defined as the harvest of hay from a single field undertaken within a 48 hour period. Depending upon the size of the field and the capacity of the harvesting equipment used, the amount of hay collected in this period can vary greatly, reaching up to .

"Home and Away" is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988. The following is a list of characters that first appeared in 1989, by order of first appearance. They were all introduced by the show's executive producer Des Monaghan. The 2nd season of "Home and Away" began airing on 23 January 1989. The first introduction of the year was Martha Stewart in January. Rebecca Fisher made her first appearance in April.

Martha Stewart made her first appearance on 25 January 1989, played by Alison Mulvaney. Martha was introduced as Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) first wife through a series of flashbacks. The character was reintroduced on 27 March 2018, and the role was recast to Belinda Giblin, who previously played Cynthia Ross in 1991. Meagher told Simon Timblick of the "Radio Times" that he may have suggested Giblin for the role, saying "When it was first mentioned to me they were thinking about bringing Martha back, they hadn't started looking and I said Belinda would be terrific. I don't know whether they looked any further, it was the perfect choice." Martha has the longest gap between appearances of any character on "Home and Away". Martha was reintroduced as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations. Alf tells their daughter Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) that Martha did not die as previously thought, but she had in fact disappeared as she was unhappy with her life. Roo tries to find her mother, but is unsuccessful, until Martha makes her own way to Summer Bay. The character returns the following year, after receiving a phone call from Alf, which leads them to reconcile romantically. Meagher thought that Martha was probably the love of his life, despite his marriage to Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn). He also joked about that Martha being alive may have made Alf a bigamist. Martha temporarily leaves after her borderline personality disorder causes her anxiety. Martha was married to Alf Stewart and is the mother of their daughter, Ruth "Roo" Stewart (then Justine Clarke). She was presumed drowned after a sailing accident. Martha appears in flashbacks when Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) reads her diary entries while searching for leads on her biological parents. It is revealed that Martha knew that Alf's sister, Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) was Bobby's mother and subsequently had her adopted out to Al Simpson (George Leppard; Terence Donovan) and Doris Simpson. Decades later, when he thinks he is going to die following an explosion, Alf tells Roo that Martha did not drown, as Roo had been led to believe, and is still alive. Martha comes to Summer Bay House and meets Ryder Jackson (Lukas Radovich), who asks if she wants to rent a caravan from Alf. She leaves, but later returns and comes face to face with Alf and then Roo. Martha explains that a friend informed her Roo had come looking for her. Roo and Martha talk, but when Roo asks why Martha left her all those years ago, Martha tells her she is tired and leaves. Martha later reveals that she has borderline personality disorder. She struggled to connect with Roo and could not face up to her condition, so she left. After seeking help and treatment, the guilt and fear stopped her from coming back, but she knew Roo would have a good life. Roo tells Martha that she gave Alf a hard time and had a daughter when she was sixteen, who she named after Martha. Roo asks Martha to have dinner with Alf, but she fails to show up. The following day, Martha comes to Summer Bay House to leave her contact details for Roo and she apologises to Alf, before explaining why she left. Roo tells Martha that she needs to leave, as her presence is hurting Alf, but she will visit her. Months later, Alf calls Martha, but does not tell her why and soon hangs up on her. Martha comes to the Bay to ask him why he contacted her, but he tells her to go home. Alf later admits that he has missed her. He takes her out on his boat and Martha paints his portrait. She admits that she loves him and Alf is short with her, but after catching Martha packing her bags, they agree to see where things go between them. When Martha struggles to contact Roo, who is teaching in a remote area, she panics and works herself into a state. After Roo finally gets in contact, Martha calms down and explains to Alf that the anxiety is a result of her BPD. She decides to return home, and Alf later joins her. Upon their return to the Bay, they tell Roo that they are in a relationship. Martha leaves a few days later, having explained that she will continue to live in Marimbula. During her next visit to the Bay, Martha tells Roo that she is back to stay and Alf asks her to move in with him, which she later accepts. Martha initially struggles with the move and talks with Alex Neilson (Zoe Ventoura) about her mental health. Alex refers her to a specialist at the local hospital. After returning home from a trip, Alf and Martha learn that Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger) and Robbo (Jake Ryan) have died, which prompts Alf to suggest that they get married again. Martha initially turns him down, as she does not think he is being sincere, so Alf proposes properly and she accepts. They are married a week later and leave the Bay to visit Alf's sisters. Martha continues to maintain a home and studio in Marimbula, which causes tension between the couple when Alf wants Martha to sell up. Martha tells Roo that her home in Merimbula is the place she goes to heal when she suffers from BPD. She also tells Alf that it is her safety net and they make up. Martha is contacted by her son Kieran Baldivis (Rick Donald) and she confides in Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) about him. She decides to go to Merimbula to see him and tell him about her marriage to Alf. On her return to the Bay, she tells Alf about Kieran. He asks whether she would have told him if Kieran had not contacted her, but realises she probably would not have done. Martha then tells Roo that she has a half brother, and explains that their relationship is complicated and he has not been in her life for a number of years. Martha admits to Alf and Roo that she was terrified she was going to lose them if they knew about Kieran. She also tells them that Kieran is keen to meet them and he soon shows up in the Bay.

Stevenson quit the serial in 1994 Stevenson describes Adam is "a bit of a layabout" who is "capable of a kind word and good deed every now and then". However, Adam would "rather not" do either if doing so "interferes with having a good time or a lazy time". Stevenson said that he liked playing Adam, but noted he was nothing like his character because he is more responsible than Adam is.

Beatrice was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister Margaret was married to Boniface II, Marquess of Montferrat. After the death of their mother, their father married Cecile of Baux and had further children including Boniface, Count of Savoy and a younger Beatrice. Beatrice was first betrothed not long after her birth on 4 March 1223 to Manfred III, Marquess of Saluzzo. However, the contract was broken off but was then renewed on 2 October 1227; a contract signed on that date refers to the dowry of Beatrice. The couple were married in March 1233. They were married for eleven years until Manfred's death in 1244, leaving Beatrice with two children and pregnant with twins.

Antonio Maria Ciocchi del Monte (died 20 September 1533) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal. Early years, ca. 1462 1503. Antonio Maria Ciocchi del Monte was born in Monte San Savino sometime between late September 1461 and early September 1462. He was the son of Fabiano Ciocchi and Jacopa, daughter of Gaspare, whose family name is not known. His father dropped the surname "Ciocchi" taking "del Monte San Savino" as his surname (soon shortened to "del Monte"). Antonio Maria Ciocchi del Monte was the uncle of Pope Julius III. As a young man, Ciocchi del Monte became a doctor of both laws. He then joined his older brother in Rome. He was soon appointed a consistorial advocate by the Roman Curia. His legal talents brought him to the attention of Pope Innocent VIII, who considered him a valuable advisor. Innocent VIII made him archpriest of Sant'Angelo in Vado, and, in 1492, archpriest of Arezzo. Ciocchi del Monte also found favor with Pope Alexander VI. On March 27, 1493, Alexander VI made him an auditor of the Roman Rota. In 1495, he was made rector of Sant'Agnese in Arezzo, and in 1496, provost of San Luciano near Monte San Savino. After spending time attending to his pastoral duties, he was recalled to Rome in 1498 and placed in charge of the daily operations of the Roman Rota. In July 1502, the pope put him in charge of all operations of the Roman Rota in the areas under the control of the pope's son, Cesare Borgia. He set up a judicial seat in Cesena. He was also made a protonotary apostolic at this time. In early 1503, Cesare Borgia elevated Ciocchi del Monte to the post of governor of Romagna. Bishop, 1503 11. On August 4, 1503, he was elected Bishop of Citt di Castello. He was unable to take possession of this see, however, because it was claimed by Giulio Vitelli, backed by the force of arms of the powerful Vitelli family, even though Giulio Vitelli had been deprived of the office by Pope Alexander VI. Pope Julius II made Ciocchi del Monte governor of Cesena, and, on July 26, 1504, named him an auditor of the Apostolic Camera. The pope also confirmed that the diocese of Citt di Castello belonged to Ciocchi del Monte and in June 1505, threatened to place Citt di Castello under interdict. The city finally relented and Ciocchi del Monte took possession of the diocese in July 1505. He was consecrated as a bishop in San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome on January 4, 1506 by Tito Veltri di Viterbo, Bishop of Castro. On February 6, 1506, he was promoted to the metropolitan see of Manfredonia, occupying that office until May 30, 1511. Cardinal, 1511 33. Pope Julius II made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of March 10, 1511. He received the red hat on March 13, 1511, and the titular church of San Vitale on March 17, 1511. A short time later, he became the cardinal protector of the Servite Order. From May 30, 1511 to March 13, 1521, he was the administrator of the see of Pavia. In 1511, the pope placed Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte in charge of dealing with the four cardinals who had joined in the proposal of Louis XII of France to hold a schismatic council at Pisa. In this capacity, he was crucial in convincing Pope Julius II to call the Fifth Council of the Lateran and played a large role in organizing that council. He was made a member of the council's commission for the reform of the Roman Curia and its officials on June 3, 1513. He participated in the papal conclave of 1513 that elected Pope Leo X. The new pope sent him to Umbria to restore order following the chaos brought about by Louis XII's invasion of that province. The cardinal opted for the titular church of Santa Prassede on July 14, 1514. He served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals from 1516 to 1517. He was also administrator of the see of Novara from April 19, 1516 until December 20, 1525. In spring 1517, several cardinals participated in a conspiracy to assassinate Pope Leo X. The pope placed Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte in charge of pursuing the case against the ringleaders of the conspiracy, Cardinals Alfonso Petrucci and Bandinello Sauli. He successfully secured their convictions and those two cardinals were executed. Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte opted for the order of cardinal bishops on July 24, 1521, receiving the Suburbican Diocese of Albano. He participated in the papal conclave of 1521 22 that elected Pope Adrian VI. In February 1523, the new pope placed him in charge of a commission in charge of reducing expenditures by reducing curial offices created by Leo X. In the consistory of July 23, 1523, Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte opposed the creation of a defensive league with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, fearing it would strain relations with Francis I of France. He participated in the papal conclave of 1523 that elected Pope Clement VII. The new pope named him cardinal protector of the Oratory of Divine Love, the predecessor of the Theatines; he filled this role until 1529.

He also became Vice Dean of the College of Cardinals at this time. In 1526, Pope Clement VII concluded the treaty forming the League of Cognac, allying the Papal States with the Kingdom of France, the Republic of Venice, and the House of Sforza against Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. On May 22, 1526, Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte was one of the leading commissioners responsible for preparing the Papal States for the War of the League of Cognac. His efforts, however, were totally inadequate to prevent the Sack of Rome (1527). He was one of the small number of cardinals who remained loyal to the pope, seeking refuge with him in the Castel Sant'Angelo. On June 5, 1527, he was one of the seven cardinals who signed the capitulation to the imperial forces and his nephew, Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (the future Pope Julius III) was taken hostage by imperial forces. From 1528, he was one of the leading cardinals responsible for dealing with Henry VIII of England's attempts to secure a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. The cardinal supported King Henry's attempts to secure a divorce, and was friendly with the English embassy; he was, however, unable to convince the pope to grant the request for a divorce. From February to July 1530 he was administrator of the see of Alatri. When Charles V wrote to the pope and the College of Cardinals in 1530 requesting a general council to resolve the question of the rise of Lutheranism in Germany, Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte rushed back to Rome and voiced his support for the proposal. No council was forthcoming, however. When the pope traveled to Marseille in September 1533 to attend the marriage of Henry II, Duke of Orl ans and Catherine de' Medici, he left Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte in charge of Rome as papal legate. The pope agreed to the cardinal's request to allow his nephew Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte to assist in the discharge of these duties. He died in Rome on September 20, 1533. He was buried in San Pietro in Montorio. When his nephew became pope, he commissioned Giorgio Vasari and Bartolomeo Ammannati to work on the cardinal's tomb.

The 2012 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby (known through sponsorship as the State Farm Home Run Derby) was a home run hitting contest in Major League Baseball (MLB) between four batters each from the American League and National League. The derby was held on July 9, 2012, at the site of the 2012 MLB All Star Game, Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Prince Fielder won the derby with five home runs in the first round, eleven home runs in the second round, and twelve runs in the finals. His twelve home runs in the final round ties Robinson Can 's record for final round home runs, set in 2011. Fielder beat Toronto outfielder Jos Bautista in the final round, 12 7. Rules. Each participant is thrown pitches by a pitcher of his choice. The hitter has the option of not swinging at a pitch without penalty. If he swings at a pitch and misses or hits the pitch anywhere but in home run territory, it is considered an out. Each player hits until he records ten outs in each round. When nine outs are reached in each round, the "gold money ball" comes into play, in which State Farm donates a certain amount of money to charities if a home run is hit. This repeats until the batter records the final out. In the first two rounds, home run totals will carry over for those rounds. Should there be a tie after either of the first two rounds, a "swing off" takes place. In a swing off, each tied player gets five swings to hit as many home runs as possible. If after the five swings a tie still remains, players get three more swings to determine the winner; if needed, sudden death swings continue until one player homers. Home runs hit during a first round swing off do not count towards the player's total going into the second round. All eight players participate in the first round; the four highest totals from round one will move to the semi finals. The players with top two totals will face off in the finals, with the scores reset from the first two rounds. Robinson Can booing controversy. Yankees' second baseman Robinson Can was at the center of a controversy involving booing from the live Kauffman Stadium fans. Can was the American League's captain for the Home Run Derby and was responsible for picking the other participants. In June, Can said that the right thing to do would be to choose a player from the hosting Kansas City Royals. However, he ultimately picked Prince Fielder, Jos Bautista, and Mark Trumbo (who finished in first, second, and third place respectively) as the AL representatives, leaving out Billy Butler of the Royals. The fans in attendance at the Derby expressed their displeasure at the snub, and heavily jeered Can with booing during his performance at the derby. Can did not hit a single home run during the derby and finished in last place. Later, Can claimed that Kansas City fans targeted his family during their jeers at the All Star festivities.

The Ruger Red Label was an over and under shotgun that was built by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. at the direction of William B. Ruger. History. When the Browning Superposed was introduced in 1931, American sportsmen soon fell in love with the concept of a stacked barrel double gun. Unlike traditional side by side double barrel shotguns that have issues with aiming points and recoil, a shotgun with two barrels stacked one on top of the other offers a single sighting plane and lighter recoil. The Superposed became the first mass produced Over/Under (O/U) shotgun. By the 1970s the Belgian made Browning Superposed, and other over and under shotguns imported from Europe had become so expensive that they were out of reach of most American shooters, and there were no domestically produced over and under shotguns that did not cost more. The Red Label was introduced in 1977 in 20 Gauge with a 26" barrel for a price of $480.00 (equal to $2,074.95 in 2018) At the time the Remington Model 3200 was the only other quality American Made over under, and it cost nearly twice as much. The Red Label soon proved a hit with the American shooting public for its affordability, reliability, and handling. It remained in production for over three decades. In 1979, Ruger began to offer the Red Label in 12 Gauge and eventually a scaled down version in 28 Gauge (1994). The design was born of William B. Ruger's desire to produce a quality US made over and under shotgun. In order to achieve this and put quality on par with hand made European shotguns, Ruger invested in expensive machinery to do most of the work. Design. The Red Label originally featured a blued receiver. Later models utilized a stainless steel receiver with hammer forged barrels. The shooter could determine which barrel to fire by means of a selector mounted on the tang. Early production models typically had fixed chokes but most Red Labels manufactured since the mid 1980s were tapped to accept screw in choke tubes for various purposes. The butt stock and forend are oil finished American walnut with machine cut checkering on the grip and forend. The Red Label was available with either an English straight stock or a pistol grip stock. The checkering pattern changed several times during the production run. Several variants of the Red Label were offered by Ruger including the Woodside. Introduced in 1995 and produced until 2002, the Ruger Red Label Woodside used select Circassian walnut for its forearm and buttstock, which extended into the action on two side panels. Ruger also offered an all weather version of the Red Label with stainless steel barrels and a black, synthetic forearm and buttstock. Hand Engraving at extra cost was offered by several master engravers including John J. Adams, John Adams II, Bryson Gwinnell, Carmine Lombardy, Alvin White, Andrew Bourdin, and Jon Ashford of Ruger. In 1999 Ruger's 50th Anniversary special CNC cut engraved with 24 kt Gold Birds 28 gauge Grouse, 20 gauge Pheasant, 12 gauge Duck. Later produced CNC cut engraved 28 gauge gold Woodcock, 20 gauge gold Grouse, 12 gauge gold Pheasant and 12 gauge All Weather gold Duck. The Red Label was primarily intended as a sporting shotgun for waterfowling, upland game hunting as well as in skeet and sporting clays. Criticism. Criticism of the Red Label included complaints about the weight of the shotgun, poor balance when swinging the gun onto a flying target, poor fit of the metal to wood on some examples, and loose (rattling) sighting ribs. Many shooters disliked the automatic safety (which could be disabled by the factory if requested by the owner.). Production decline. By 2010, the Red Label's sticker price had grown to $1,899, and production had dropped to only 1,323 guns. Although originally conceived as a quality affordable American made alternative to pricey hand made European shotguns, competition from imported brands had increased substantially. Production of the Red Label was discontinued by Ruger in 2011. Redesign. A redesigned Red Label was introduced by Ruger in 2013, though only in 12 gauge. The new version was lighter and featured refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil. These improvements were designed to deliver improved comfort and enhanced shooting performance and make the gun lighter to carry in the field. According to Ruger the new 12 gauge Red Label had a redistributed center of gravity for even greater instinctual swing and pointing. It also featured two inch extended forcing cones, maximum back bored barrels and a soft Pachmayr buttpad to enhance the shooting experience with reduced recoil. The suggested retail price for the new Red Label was $1,399 which was approximately $500 less than MSRP of the original when it was discontinued. The price drop was achieved by streamlining the manufacturing processes, making the shotgun less costly to produce. Final Production. In January 2015, Ruger dropped the Red Label from its product line, citing an inability to achieve revenue expectations. As a consequence, Ruger no longer produces a shotgun in its model line. Accessories and choke tubes for the Ruger Red Label shotgun are still available from Ruger as of 2017.

Europejara is a genus of tapejarid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous period of Spain. The type and only species known is Europejara olcadesorum. Discovery and naming. In 2012, the type species "Europejara olcadesorum" was named and described by Romain Vullo, Jes s Marug n Lob n, Alexander Kellner, Angela Buscalioni, Bernard Gomez, Montserrat de la Fuente and Jos Moratalla. The generic name combines the names of Europe and the related genus "Tapejara", in reference to the fact that "Europejara" is the first tapejarid found in that continent. The specific name refers to the Olcades, the Celtiberic tribe inhabiting the region of Cuenca, the location of the find, in Antiquity. The holotype, MCCM LH 9413, was uncovered at the Las Hoyas site in a chalkstone layer of the Calizas de La Huergina Formation dating from the late Barremian. It consists of a partial skull with lower jaws, compressed on a slab and counterslab. Two elements of the hyoid are present also. The skull has been vertically crushed, the lower jaws horizontally. The specimen was prepared by Mercedes Llandres Serrano, and is part of the Las Hoyas collection of the Museo de las Ciencias de Castilla La Mancha. Description. "Europejara" is a relatively small form with an estimated wingspan of . The jaws are toothless and the lower jaws bear a large downwards pointing crest. The describers established three autapomorphies, unique derived traits. The crest on the lower jaws is curved to the back. The crest is deeper than its base, measured from the front to the back, is wide. The crest is four times deeper than the back of the jaw. Two other diagnostic traits were indicated: the inner side of the lower jaw is thickened, causing a convex curvature; the inner side shows some shallow, but well demarcated, depressions. Due to the crushing of the skull, its fragments, mainly representing elements from the area around the right eye socket, show little detail. The lower jaws have a preserved length of and an estimated original length of . In their front parts the lower jaws are fused by a symphysis into a mandibula. The symphysis has a concave upper profile and features a large crest on the underside, pointing downwards for at least . The back edge of the crest is recurved; the curvature of the front edge cannot be exactly established because of damage. The crest is the longest relative to lower jaw length of any known pterosaur. The internal bone structure of the crest is spongy. The rod like first ceratobranchialia pair of the hyoid have a length of and a cross section of . Phylogeny. "Europejara" was assigned to the Tapejaridae. A cladistic analysis showed it to be more precisely a member of the Tapejarinae. Apart from being the first tapejarid known from Europe, it would also be the oldest pterosaur with certainty known to be edentulous; older fragments have been reported representing other generally toothless clades but these did not include the jaws themselves. The cladogram below follows a phylogenetic analysis by Kellner, one of the describers of "Europejara", and colleagues in 2019. They recovered "Europejara" within the tribe Tapejarini, sister taxon to three other genera: "Caiuajara", "Tapejara", and "Tupandactylus". Paleobiology. Following earlier suggestions about the diet of tapejarids, the describers assumed a frugivorous lifestyle for "Europejara". Because the species is so old it indicates a role for the tapejarids in the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, a turn over in the ecosystems of the Lower Cretaceous in which gymnosperms were replaced by angiosperms, flowering plants, and new groups of herbivores evolved, adapted to the changed food supply. In the case of tapejarids there could have been a reinforcing interactive cycle between the evolution of fruit and the pterosaurs dispersing the seed. Possibly the beaks of the tapejarids had ragged edges forming pseudo teeth to better separate the fruit flesh from the seeds, as with some extant toucans.

Isidorella is a genus of air breathing freshwater snails, aquatic pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Planorbidae, the ram's horn snails. All species within family Planorbidae have sinistral shells. Species of "Isidorella" may appear to be very similar species of "Glyptophysa". However, "Isidorella" may differentiated by their lack of a stylet and an accessory structure. "Isidorella" also have a two lobed penis, unlike "Glyptophysa". Distribution. This genus is endemic to mainland Australia. Species. Species within this genus include: Walker (1988) considered all examined specimens from Australia from this genus as "Isidorella newcombi" sensu lato. Ecology. "Isidorella" snails are grazers scrapers and are capable of aestivation. "Isidorella" may be found in ponds, billabongs, swamps, and sluggish streams and rivers.

Nawab Sayyid Hassan Ali Khan Barha (1666 12 October 1722), also known as Nawab Sayyid Mian II, Abdullah Khan II, was one of the Sayyid Brothers, and a key figure in the Mughal Empire under Farrukhsiyar. He was the eldest son of the Nawab of Ajmer, Sayyid Mian Abdullah Khan I and later inherited his father's titles as well as the name Abdullah Khan but was also frequently referred to as "Qutb al mulk", "Pivot of the Realm". Deposing emperors at their own will, both Abdullah Khan and his brother Hussain Ali Khan become the most powerful figures in early 18th century India. As de facto rulers of India, which represented the world's largest economy at the time, the Sayyid Brothers were the most influential figures in the world during their lifetimes. Ancestry. Abdullah Khan was a member of the Barha Dynasty. The meaning of the name Barha is uncertain. While some contend that it comes from the word, "bahir", meaning "outsider" referring to the preference of members of the Barha dynasty to live outside Delhi. Others like the Emperor Jahangir, believed that it came from the Hindi word, "barha", meaning "twelve". In reference to the twelve townships that members of the dynasty had received as fiefs from Sultan Shibabdudin of Ghor when they first arrived in India. The dynasty descends in the male line from the fourth Rashidun Caliph, Ali, through his younger son Hussain who married Shahrbanu, herself a daughter of the Sassanian Emperor of Persia, Yazdegard III. Due to Ali's status as an Adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to Abraham through his eldest son Ishmael. In Arabia, Abdullah Khan's ancestors took part in many rebellions against the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. One ancestor, Isa bin Zayd, revolted against the Caliph Al Mahdi and was consequently poisoned by that caliph at the age of 45. Subsequently, the dynasty were heavily persecuted by the Abbasid government, and eventually the founder of the Barha dynasty, Abul Farah Al Wasiti, fled from Madina to Wasit and from there he fled to the Ghaznavid Empire. His four sons entered into the military service of Sultan Muhammad of Ghor and received twelve fiefdoms in Punjab, then a part of the Ghor Empire, as reward for their service. Thus the dynasty became quickly established as Nobles of the Sword in ancient India, a status they held under several different empires. They held a particularly high status under the Sultanate of Delhi. When the Chief of the Barha, who was also the Diwan of the empire, was granted the fiefdom of Saharanpur due to his relation with the imperial family. They also enjoyed particularly prominent positions under the reign of the Sur, eventually defecting during the last days in the reign of Sikander Sur of the Sur Empire, to the Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire in the course of the siege of Mankot . The Barha dynasty maintains the unique status of having been the only dynasty to participate in all three Battles of Panipat, seminal battles which shaped Indian History. Under the Lodi in the First Battle of Panipat. In the Second Battle of Panipat they gained victory under Bairam Khan, and finally in the Third Battle Of Panipat, the sons of Nawab Ali Muhammad Khan Rohilla fought with Ahmed Shah Abidali against the Maratha. By the time of the Emperor Aurangzeb, the dynasty was firmly regarded as "Old Nobility" and enjoyed the unique status of holding the premier realms of Ajmer and Dakhin. Realms usually reserved for the rule of members of the Imperial Family. Biography. Over the course of his life. Abdullah Khan Barha had a hand in the installation or deposition of the Emperors: Bahadur Shah I I, Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, Rafi Ud Darajat, Shah Jahnan II, Muhammad Shah and Ibrahim. Barha was one of the main backers of Farrukhsiyar's rise to the throne. He initially served as Bakshi for the empire but later rose to become the Vezier or Prime Minister. He was additionally made the Nawab of Bihar which he ruled though proxy. Upon the assassination of his brother, Nawab Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan Barha by Turkish and Turani nobles, he led an army against the Emperor Muhammad Shah with his own puppet Emperor, Ibrahim. After large swathes of his own army deserted him, Abdullah Khan personally fought on foot following the Barha tradition and was captured by the Emperor. Eventually being poisoned on the instigation of Turkish nobles while in captivity.

Shrimp and prawn are types of seafood that are consumed worldwide. Although shrimp and prawns belong to different suborders of Decapoda, they are very similar in appearance and the terms are often used interchangeably in commercial farming and wild fisheries. A distinction is drawn in recent aquaculture literature, which increasingly uses the term "prawn" only for the freshwater forms of palaemonids and "shrimp" for the marine penaeids. In the United Kingdom, the word "prawn" is more common on menus than "shrimp"; the opposite is the case in North America. The term "prawn" is also loosely used for any large shrimp, especially those that come 15 (or fewer) to the pound (such as "king prawns", yet sometimes known as "jumbo shrimp"). Australia and some other Commonwealth nations follow this British usage to an even greater extent, using the word "prawn" almost exclusively. When Australian comedian Paul Hogan used the phrase, "I'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you" in an American television advertisement, it was intended to make what he was saying easier for his American audience to understand, and was thus a deliberate distortion of what an Australian would typically say. In Britain very small crustaceans with a brownish shell are called shrimp, and are used to make potted shrimps. They are also used in dishes where they are not the primary ingredient. The French term "" is often encountered in restaurants. Shrimp and other shellfish are among the most common food allergens. The Jewish laws of Kashrut forbid the eating of shrimp. According to the King James version of the Old Testament, it is acceptable to eat finfish, but shrimp are an abomination and should not be eaten. In Islam, the Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali and Ja'fari schools allow the eating of shrimp, while the Hanafi school does not. Nutrition. As with other seafood, shrimp is high in protein but low in food energy. A shrimp based meal is also a significant source of cholesterol, from 122 mg to 251 mg per 100 g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation. Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides. Shrimp are high in levels of omega 3s (generally beneficial) and low in levels of mercury (generally toxic), with an FDA study in 2010 showing a level of 0.001 parts per million, analysing only methylmercury. Preparation. Preparing shrimp for consumption usually involves removing the head, shell, tail, and "sand vein". A notable exception is drunken shrimp, a dish using freshwater shrimp that is often eaten alive, but immersed in ethanol to make consumption easier. To shell a shrimp, the tail is held while gently removing the shell around the body. The tail can be detached completely at this point, or left attached for presentation purposes. Removing the "sand vein" (a euphemism for the digestive tract) is referred to as "deveining". The sand vein can be removed by making a shallow cut lengthwise down the outer curve of the shrimp's body, allowing the dark ribbon like digestive tract to be removed with a pointed utensil. Special deveining tools are sometimes used but knives, skewers, and even toothpicks can be used to devein. Alternatively, if the tail has been detached, the vein can be pinched at the tail end and pulled out completely with the fingers. On large shrimp, the "blood vein" (a euphemism for the ventral nerve cord) along the inner curve of the shrimp's body is typically removed as well. The shrimp is then rinsed under cold running water. Removing the vein is not essential, as it is not poisonous and is mostly tasteless. Deveining does slightly change the flavor and makes it more consistent. Shrimp also sometimes consume small amounts of sand and the vein might thus be gritty. Shrimp and prawns are versatile ingredients. Common methods of preparation include baking, boiling, frying, grilling and barbequing . They are as delicate as eggs with regard to cooking time. When they are overcooked, they have a tough and rubbery texture. Recipes using shrimp form part of the cuisine of many cultures. Strictly speaking, dishes containing scampi should be made from the Norway lobster, a shrimp like crustacean more closely related to the lobster than shrimp. Scampi is often called the "Dublin Bay prawn", and in some places it is quite common for other prawns to be used instead. Wet shrimp is commonly used as a flavoring and as a soup base in Asian cuisines while fried shrimp is popular in North America. In Europe, shrimp is very popular, forming a necessary ingredient in Spanish ', Italian ', Portuguese "" and many other seafood dishes. Shrimp curry is very popular in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Shrimp are also found in Latin and Caribbean dishes such as enchiladas and coconut shrimp. Other recipes include jambalaya, okonomiyaki, poon choi and bagoong. Shrimp are also consumed as salad, by frying, with rice, and as shrimp guvec (a dish baked in a clay pot) in the Western and Southern coasts of Turkey. In the subject of Japanese sushi, shrimp has long been valued as the "king of sushi dane", as its composition can be either raw or cooked, and its latter preparation has often been considered a good introduction or choice for those unfamiliar to eating sushi, especially dishes involving raw fish. Marketing. Shrimp are marketed and commercialized with several issues in mind. Most shrimp are sold frozen and marketed based on their categorization of presentation, grading, colour and uniformity. Shrimp dishes. Many various dishes are prepared using shrimp as a primary ingredient. "Ebiko", or shrimp roe, sometimes translated as "shrimp flakes", is used as an ingredient in the preparation of sushi. There also exists popcorn shrimp, breaded or battered deep fried small shrimp.

Raanan Evelyn Zvi Gillon FRCP (born April 1941) was a professor of medical ethics at Imperial College London (1995 1999) where he now holds an emeritus chair. A general practitioner until his retirement in 2002, he edited the "Journal of Medical Ethics" from 1980 to 2001. He is the current president of the BMA (2019/20) having been elected President elect in 2018. Gillon is credited with making "a major philosophical contribution to critical thinking about moral issues raised by the practice of medicine" and with being "the leading British advocate and interpreter of Beauchamp and Childress's four principles approach" to moral reasoning in healthcare. Early life. Raanan Gillon was born in April 1941 in Jerusalem, to a Jewish father and English mother who had converted to Judaism. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to London, where he attended Marlborough Primary School in Chelsea and the Anglican "Religious, Royal and Ancient Foundation" of Christ's Hospital School, also known as the Bluecoat School. He resisted the school's encouragement to be confirmed in the Church of England and his father's efforts to have a Jewish Bar Mitzvah. He has been an atheist ever since, albeit one who is sympathetic to religion. Career. Gillon's interest in medical ethics was stimulated during his undergraduate training; during this time he won a British Medical Association (BMA) student essay prize on the set title "Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia". Following his graduation from medicine in 1964, Gillon wished to pursue a doctorate in Medical Ethics, but was discouraged by Oxford University's Regius Professor of Medicine, Sir George Pickering, on the grounds that the topic was not one that could be studied. While he was rejected for a house (hospital training) post in paediatrics he was offered one in geriatrics, something he attributed to his prize winning essay where he had argued for legalisation of physician assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia, a position he now repudiates. Rejecting a position in geriatrics, he subsequently worked for seven years as a medical journalist for the "Medical Tribune" before returning to medical practice. Following a number of "house jobs" he achieved membership of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and began working as a general practitioner. He once again attempted to pursue medical ethics but was told by professor David Hamlyn (UCL) that just as medical doctors were trained so were philosophers. Gillon subsequently enrolled on the philosophy undergraduate degree at Birkbeck College, London, on a part time basis and graduated in 1979. He then registered for a PhD under the supervision of professor Roger Scruton on the topic of the concept of a person. However, in 1980 he was awarded the editorship of the "Journal of Medical Ethics" and so withdrew from his doctoral studies when he took up the post in 1981. Gillon has been involved with the development of medical ethics in the UK since the 1970s and has been called the UK's leading advocate and interpreter of the four principles approach to medical ethics, pioneered by Beauchamp and Childress. Based on a series of articles written for the BMJ, Gillon's book "Philosophical Medical Ethics" has been reprinted 13 times and he is a member of the BMA's medical ethics committee. Between 1981 and 2001 he edited the "Journal of Medical Ethics" and he was a longstanding chairman of the Institute of Medical Ethics, where he is now honorary president. In 1986 he received a travel scholarship from the RCP to visit the United States and visit a number of centres that were teaching medical ethics. In the late 1970s, assisting Michael Lockwood who introduced him to Beauchamp and Childress's principles of medical ethics, Gillon taught on the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries' course, DPMSA, on philosophical medical ethics, possibly the first such course in the UK. In 1983 he set up Imperial College's one week intensive course in medical ethics, one of the first courses on the subject in the UK. As of September 2017, the course continues to run and is advertised as running in September 2018. In 2013 he was elected to the position of President of the Institute of Medical Ethics. He is also currently a Trustee of London Nightline. Gillon is currently President of the BMA (2019/20) following his election to the position of President Elect at the BMA's 2018 Annual Representative Meeting.

The Commemorative Medal for Security Operations and the Maintenance of Order () is a French commemorative medal established in the late 1950s for award to members of the French armed forces and French civil servants under military authority for service in French North Africa during the hectic years that would become the end of French colonialism in the region. Award history. The war in Algeria was and remains a sensitive subject for France, the events were only first openly officially identified as a war in 1999. The "M daille Coloniale" ("Colonial Medal") or "M daille d'Outre Mer" ("Overseas Medal") were for service overseas and the "Croix de Guerre" ("War Cross") was for service in wartime against an exterior enemy. There was no award at the time to recognize and reward combat service on what was essentially French soil. A medal was initially created by decree 56 1032 of 12 October 1956 and called the "M daille Comm morative des Op rations de S curit et de Maintien de l'Ordre en Afrique du Nord" (). It was designed to fill this void and recognize their service in what was officially called a "police action" to quell disorder, rather than a military campaign against an armed and organized enemy. Decree 58 24 of 11 January 1958 modified the design and renamed the award to "M daille Comm morative des Op rations de S curit et de Maintien de l'Ordre" (). Under pressure for years by veterans' organizations and from the personnel who served during the handovers in Tunisia and Morocco to get commemorative medals of their own, the French government finally ceded by a decree dated 26 July 2004 with an amendment to the 1958 decree governing the award. Rather than design a new medal for each operation in North Africa, the government decided to extend the eligibility, the existing medal could then be awarded to anyone who had served in North Africa during the 1950s and 1960s. Award statute. The North Africa Security and Order Operations Commemorative Medal was awarded to: Five different gilt clasps could be earned and worn simultaneously when awarded. Award description.

On the reverse, the relief inscription on five lines "M DAILLE" "COMM MORATIVE" "OP RATIONS S CURIT " "ET MAINTIEN" "DE L'ORDRE" () surrounded by a wreath of oak and olive leaves along the medal circumference. The pre January 1958 variant had the reverse inscription on four lines "M DAILLE" "COMM MORATIVE" "D'AFRIQUE" "DU NORD" ().

The red silk moir ribbon was 36mm wide with a 14mm central light blue stripe and two 5mm wide white stripes each 1mm from the edge.
London Consequences is a 1972 group novel written by twenty writers published for the Festivals of London that year. Margaret Drabble and B. S. Johnson conceived and edited the novel. The editors wrote the first and last chapters together, gave the other novelists a brief outline of the two main characters. Each author would write his or her chapter, then pass the accumulating manuscript onto the next author. The interior chapters are by Rayner Heppenstall, Eva Figes, Gillian Freeman, Jane Gaskell, Wilson Harris, Olivia Manning, Adrian Mitchell, Paul Ableman, John Bowen, Melvyn Bragg, Vincent Brome, Peter Buckman, Alan Burns, Barry Cole, Julian Mitchell, Andrea Newman, Piers Paul Read and Stefan Themerson. The book did not identify authors' individual contributions. The G.L.A.A. ("Greater London Arts Association") offered a prize of 100 to anyone who correctly identified each chapter's author. Entry forms appeared at the back of the book. Readers had until 11 August 1972 to enter. John Moynihan writing in The Sunday Telegraph, thought it a "harmless giggle". John Whitley writing in The Sunday Times said the novel had little merit, citing the poorly drawn characters whom he described as "cloudy menaces" and the book's numerous continuity errors. Jim Hunter in The Listener complained that the chapters seem very alike, and little of the prose distinct but felt that "the book has its moments" and that "the amicable co operation of even three, let alone 20 novelists has rarity value." Valerie Grosvenor Myer writing for the Tribune complained that "ultimately such eccentricity and wilfulness break up the book. It also seems mean of the editors not to tell us what did happen to the character called Twomey, except that Anthony did not fulfil his vow to kill him."

Jean Pierre Christin (31 May 1683 19 January 1755) was a French physicist, mathematician, astronomer and musician. His proposal in 1743 to reverse the Celsius thermometer scale (from water boiling at 0 degrees and ice melting at 100 degrees, to where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water) was widely accepted and is still in use today. Christin was born in Lyon. He was a founding member of the "" and served as its Permanent Secretary from 1713 until 1755. His thermometer was known in France before the Revolution as the thermometer of Lyon. One of these thermometers was kept at the Science Museum in London. Thermometer of Lyon. The first thermometers used in Lyon were made according to the indications of Ren Antoine Ferchault de R aumur, who created the alcohol thermometer in 1730 and applied a graduation divided into 80 parts between the melting point of water 0 and the boiling point 80 . After experimenting, Christin considered that the mercury thermometer was preferable to the one with alcohol and pronounced in favor of its instrumentation in a conference on 13 June 1740. He noticed the idea of the centesimal division when, in his research, he observed that a quantity of mercury poured into a test tube, first condensed by the cold of crushed ice and then expanded by the heat of boiling water, moved its volume from 66 to 67 parts of the tube and represented them as 6600 and 6700 parts. By registering the mercury dilated in one hundred parts, he found it natural to divide the space traveled by one hundred hundredths, being that these new units, smaller than those of R aumur, would be more in harmony with the sensations caused by the variations in temperature. With this in mind, in 1743 he created the mercury based "thermometer of Lyon" and with its new centigrade degree thermometer with 0 degrees to indicate the temperature at which the water reaches its point of fusion and 100 degrees where it reaches its boiling point.

Ron Tonkin Field, originally Hillsboro Ballpark, is a baseball park in the northwest United States, located in Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb west of Portland. The stadium has a capacity of 4,500 spectators (3,534 seats) and is the home for the Hillsboro Hops of the High A West and the Post 6 Barbers of the American Legion Oregon Zone 2 Division. Groundbreaking for the $15.55 million venue was on September 21, 2012, with the first game played nine months later on June 17, 2013. The ballpark is adjacent to Hillsboro Stadium, a multi sport stadium owned by the city of Hillsboro, with both stadiums located inside the city's Gordon Faber Recreation Complex. Ron Tonkin Field hosts the only professional baseball team in the Portland metropolitan area. History. Following the Portland Beavers exit after the 2010 season when a new ballpark was not built, minor league baseball's Northwest League approached the city of Hillsboro about relocating a team to the city. Once the Beavers left, the Portland market was the most populous in the country without a professional baseball team. The league and city then started discussions around September 2011 about Hillsboro building a stadium in the city's Gordon Faber Recreation Complex near Sunset Highway. The city announced in March 2012 that it was in discussions with the Northwest League to bring a Single A team to the city. Milwaukie on the eastern side of the Portland metropolitan area also had plans to build a stadium for a minor league team. Hillsboro proposed to build a four to six thousand seat ballpark adjacent to Hillsboro Stadium at the Faber Complex, with plans to open for the 2013 season. Total construction budget for the new stadium was originally expected to be $15.2 million. To pay for the construction, the city would sell bonds and repay the money using revenue from the facility, including leasing the field to the minor league team. Early projections hoped to have attendance between 100,000 and 180,000 total for the 38 home games. While the league had two teams in mind for relocation, the Yakima Bears became the leading candidate, as the team previously failed to land a new stadium at Clark College in the Vancouver, Washington, area. The other team interested in relocation was the Boise Hawks. By April 2012, the Hillsboro City Council approved issuing a request for proposals to design and build a stadium, and hired a sports attorney to assist in the process. The new 4,500 seat stadium, to be built on field four at the complex, is planned to have covered seating, a new orientation to face east, a beer garden, an entry plaza with artwork, and more concession stands. On April 16, the City Council considered authorizing up to $30 million in full faith and credit bonds to pay for several projects, including a baseball stadium. Repayment of the bonds would come from revenue generated by the stadium, and if necessary, discretionary funds from the general budget. City officials expected a $7.1 million economic impact annually from the stadium, and said the overall cost of the project would be half of what would normally be expected due to the existing infrastructure at the complex. The council announced they might vote at their May 15 meeting to authorize the $15 million project, start negotiating a lease agreement with the team, and hire SRG Partnership to design the stadium with Hoffman Construction building the $13.4 million stadium. However, the city council did not consider the matter at that meeting as planned, as negotiations were still continuing with the Yakima Bears and the league. Two weeks later, the Council announced they would again look at approving a term sheet with the owners of the Yakima franchise, and that the league had two teams interested in possibly relocating to Hillsboro. The deal with the Bears called for a 20 year lease on a $13.4 million stadium, with the team paying rent of $150,000 per year. The rent would increase 3% each year, with the team retaining concession revenues and the city keeping parking revenues, among other provisions. The city was also to consider contracting with Hoffman Construction to build the stadium, and hire SRG Partnership for the design. The city expects to sell naming rights to the stadium, with the city keeping 70% of the proceeds. On June 5, the city council approved the offer sheet with Short Season, LLC in a unanimous vote, and agreed to hire Hoffman and SRG to design and build the facility. The deal was contingent upon Short Season signing off on the deal, plus approval of the league, as well as both Minor and Major League Baseball. The city also acknowledged that revenues may not be enough to cover the debt payment, and that the city may need to use funds paid by Intel Corporation to the city as part of that company's tax breaks or other city funds to cover any shortfall. Both the Bears and the Northwest League approved the offer sheet on June 8, and the city signed an agreement with the team on June 26. Final approval of the move was needed by September 4, 2012, from the league, Minor League Baseball, and Major League Baseball (MLB), with construction scheduled to start in October 2012. Milwaukie still hoped to land a team from the league as well, and their plan had the support of Portland Mayor Sam Adams. MLB gave the final approval in August 2012 for the relocation, clearing the way for construction to begin. A ground breaking ceremony with local leaders and team ownership was held on September 21, 2012. In February 2013, the main piece of public art was revealed to be a sculpture entitled "Barometer" to be created by Devin Laurence Field. Construction ended in mid June 2013 with a public opening on June 13. The final construction costs totaled $15.55 million. The Hops' first home game was on June 17, 2013, with a sellout crowd of 4,710 in attendance. The stadium was named project of the year for 2013 by the American Public Works Association for public projects in Oregon between $5 and $25 million. On May 13, 2014, the Ron Tonkin Family of Dealerships signed a ten year naming rights deal with the city at $150,000 per year, giving the ballpark its new name of Ron Tonkin Field. Tonkin Field hosted the Northwest League's all star game in 2017. Features. Ron Tonkin Field has a capacity of approximately 4,500 spectators.

Victoria Stroman High School served as a high school for the Victoria Independent School District in Victoria, Texas, United States from 1967 to 2000, when it consolidated with Victoria High School to become Memorial High School. Due to the districts changes in 2010, the old campus is now used as Stroman Middle School. History. In 1898, with the creation of Victoria ISD, Victoria joined other Texas towns in establishing public education. Central High School (later called Mitchell and currently Mitchell Guidance Center) became the first public school for white students in 1900. Negro High School (renamed F.W. Gross High School in 1925 and currently F.W. Gross Montessori School) became the first public school for African American students in 1901. While "Brown v. Board of Education" determined segregation in public schools was unconstitutional in 1954, Victoria didn't start integrating schools until 1958. In 1957, Victoria High School opened its doors, but it did not become the first integrated high school in Victoria until 1961. F.W. Gross graduated its last class in 1966, closing its doors for Stroman to open in 1967. The VISD Board of Trustees named the high school after O.C. Stroman, affectionately called the father of Victoria tennis. By his retirement in 1964, Stroman had the longest tenure of any teacher in the Victoria public school system. He served as a tennis coach from 1932 to 1964, and he died in 1965. In 1991, VISD started serious discussion about overcrowding and ethnic enrollment pattern imbalances at Victoria and Stroman high schools. Victoria citizens strongly opposed losing Stroman High School to proposed restructuring of the schools, and the trustees voted in favor of keeping Stroman during that time. The issues resurfaced in 1999, and with multiple options on the table, the trustees determined it was time to plan for a consolidation of the two high schools. In 2000, the two schools were consolidated into Memorial High School, with Victoria High becoming the Senior Campus (juniors and seniors) and Stroman High becoming the Stroman Campus (freshmen and sophomores). In 2006, sophomores were moved to the Senior Campus. In 2010, Memorial High School closed, and the Stroman Campus became Stroman Middle School. Stroman is now part of the East Learning Center, feeding into Victoria East High School. Stroman Middle School's feeder schools are Dudley Gifted and Talented Magnet Elementary School, O'Connor Magnet Elementary School, Smith Magnet Elementary School, and Torres Elementary School.

John Hooke (1655 1712) was a lawyer and judge in England and Wales. Life. He was born in Ireland. His grandfather, Thomas Hooke (died 1672), was a merchant who supported Parliament during the Civil Wars of the 1640s, and who became mayor of Dublin in 1654. His father, also called John Hooke, was a nonconformist Protestant minister. Hooke's education included grammar school in Kilkenny College and university in Trinity College Dublin. In 1675 he moved to England to undertake legal studies at Gray's Inn in London, and qualified as a barrister in 1681. He married Elizabeth Lambert, daughter of imprisoned Parliamentary general John Lambert. The marriage brought useful connections within commercial circles and Hooke's legal career flourished. Having bought land in West New Jersey and considered emigrating to America during the reign of King James II, Hooke decided to remain in England after the Revolution of 1688 brought William of Orange to power. Gaining favour with the new regime, he was promoted to serve as a judge in North Wales in 1689. He became the senior judge in the area in 1695, and added a position Chester to his other duties.

He was dogged by controversy and involved in complicated legal actions from 1707 until the end of his life. Accused of accepting gifts contrary to the rules governing his position as a judge, he was investigated by a committee of the House of Commons. Although exonerated in a vote of the House, his position was further undermined by a bitter dispute with Daniel Coxe, his former partner in land investment in New Jersey, which ended up in the Chancery Court in London. Hooke died in 1712 with neither controversy satisfactorily settled. He wrote a book on religion, "Catholicism Without Popery: An Essay to Render the Church of England a Means and a Pattern of Union to the Christian World" (London, 1699). Family. Hooke was survived by his wife Elizabeth, his son Nathaniel Hooke the historian, and his brother, also Nathaniel Hooke, a soldier, intelligence agent and ambassador in French service.

Mary plans to return to New York, refusing any settlement and sadly renouncing custody of her daughter and all claims.

The adversaries of Mancera were Beatriz Paredes Rangel, for the Commitment to Mexico coalition, an alliance of political parties Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), Isabel Miranda de Wallace for the National Action Party (PAN), and Rosario Guerra for the New Alliance Party (PANAL). According to surveys made in late January, Mancera was between 18 and 30 points ahead of Paredes. However, the following month, electoral preferences that favored him decreased by nine points. Electoral preference for Mancera then increased from 36% in March to 41% in April in an "El Universal" daily poll. In May, Mancera favorability increased to 57.5%; in the same month, Adolfo Hellmund, Luis Mandoki, and Costa Bonino, in the house of Luis Creel, borrowed six million dollars on behalf of Mancera and L pez Obrador, but both politicians disassociated themselves from the incident, and Mancera filed a complaint against the people responsible for using his name without authorization with the Attorney General of Mexico City. As candidate, the proposals of Mancera included to continue Ebrard's policies, an increase of 13,000 to 20,000 safety cameras, a reduction of car travel time, the expansion of the Mexico City Metro , a review of the issue of solid waste, the minibuses will be removed from the streets, 18 water purification plants, a Green Plan, the replacement of garbage trucks to separate organic and inorganic waste, among others. On 1 July 2012, exit polls noted that Mancera was the presumed winner of the election, with a margin of 59.5 64.5%, and had approximately 40% more votes than the second place candidate, Paredes. On 7 July 2012, the Federal District Electoral Institute (IEDF) announced Mancera as Head of Government elect, endorsing him with a certificate; which he received on 8 October 2012. Mancera assumed office on 5 December 2012, as the sixth Mayor of Mexico City.

On 7 April 2013, Mexican actress Laura Zapata asked Mancera to help her son, whose car had been crashed and the responsible escaped. Mancera asked Rodolfo R os, then Attorney General of Mexico City, to take the case. Because of this, he was criticized by Twitter users because of "selectively attending requests from citizens." In November 2013, Mancera announced the increase of the Mexico City Metro fare, from three pesos to five, per travel. According to the Metro operator, Sistema Transporte Colectivo, with the increase the system would use the earnings for several uses, including the improvement of the infrastructure and maintainment of its 12 lines and its 195 stations. The decision was criticized by sectors of the city population because its increase would represent a "blow up in the economy" of the inhabitants, as the minimum wage in Mexico City was 64.76 pesos, as of January 2013. Mancera announced three opinion poll companies would ask to 7,200 Metro users if the fare should be increased, polling from 28 November to 2 December; the respondents represented less than the 1% of the 5.5 million daily users who use the system. According to the results from the companies Parametr a (with 53.3%), Consulta Mitofsky (with 56.2%) and Covarrubias y Asociados (with 57.6%), the increment was approved to be applied since 13 December. Due to this, through the Movimiento Pos Me Salto, users called to civil disobedience protests by jumping over the turnstiles. However, Mexico City Government announced they would take legal actions against those who skip them. Investigations of Miguel ngel Mancera's administration. Upon the arrival of Claudia Sheinbaum as his successor as Mayor of Mexico City several investigations were initiated by the . They included the prosecution of various crimes and administrative offenses that were allegedly done in Mancera's administration, as well as to some close collaborators. Among those who have been investigated or sanctioned include: In 2020, 1,680 public servants were sanctioned by Mexico City Comptroller Office in different ways. On 5 October 2020, the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary (TEPJF, in Spanish) sanctioned Mancera with a one year disqualification to any public role in Mexico City after determining that he promoted a presidential candidate, Ricardo Anaya, in 2018, while being Head of Government, and sanctioned by Mexican electoral laws.

They divorced two years later, and after six years Mancera married Magnolia, with whom he had two children, Miguel and Leonardo. After a decade, he divorced Magnolia. Mancera has a daughter out of wedlock, but he has said the child's mother does not want Mancera to see her. From 2008 to 2009, Mancera dated Alejandra Barrales, who was the president of the PRD party at that time, who intended on becoming the PRD candidate for Mayor of Mexico City in 2012. In September 2007, two assailants on a motorcycle intercepted and attempted to rob him while he drove his BMW in Perif rico Sur. His bodyguard intervened and shot one of the robbers, killing him.

Vare was ultimately unseated in December 1929 by the Senate, following charges of corruption.
The bony eared assfish ("Acanthonus armatus") is a bathypelagic species of cusk eel found in tropical and sub tropical oceans at depths of from . It has been found as far north as Queen Charlotte Sound off British Columbia's coast. This species grows to a length of SL. It is the only known member of its genus "Acanthonus". The bony eared assfish holds the record for the smallest brain to body weight ratio of all vertebrates. Like many other creatures that dwell in the depths of the sea, assfish are soft and flabby with a light skeleton. This is likely to have resulted from a lack of food and the high pressures which accompany living at such a depth, making it difficult to generate muscle and bone. Etymology. The type specimen was an 11.5 inch (29.2 cm) individual taken by the Challenger expedition (1872 1876) north of New Guinea at a depth of 1075 fathoms (6450 ft). It was described in 1878 by German ichthyologist Albert G nther, who gave the species its scientific name. Armatus means "armed" in Latin, likely chosen because the fish sports spines off the tip of the nose and the gills. This also perhaps accounts for the "bony eared" part, according to Gavin Hanke, curator of vertebrate zoology at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia. Akanthos is Greek for "prickly", and onus could either mean "hake, a relative of cod", Hanke says, "or a donkey". Adam Summers, associate director at the Friday Harbor Laboratories at the University of Washington, concurs, saying onus could easily read "as a homonym of the Greek word for ass".

This action dovetailed with the birther movement started in 2008 repudiating Barack Obama's natural citizenship. The measure ultimately failed to pass. In 2013, Burges fought against US involvement with the United Nations initiative, Agenda 21, the Rio declaration of environmental principles, claiming that she would "certainly call it communism." She further falsely claimed that Brazil is a communist nation. In April 2014, Burges traveled to Nevada and showed support for rancher Cliven Bundy, who was resisting a cattle round up after refusing to pay grazing fees since 1993. "I stand with them," Burges said of the Bundy family. In 2017 Burges had an email exchange with an elderly constituent that was widely publicized.

Srinivasa "Hal" Iyengar (born 6 May 1934 died 4 July 2019) was an Indian American civil engineer and a senior structural consultant, who has been particularly instrumental in the development of innovative and efficient structural concepts and systems for high rise, long span and stadium structures. Early life and education. Iyengar was born in Mysore, India to a prominent civil engineering family and obtained a bachelor's degree in civil engineering as valedictorian of University of Mysore. Traveling with his father to building sites, Iyengar became passionate about civil engineering early on. He went on to earn a master's degree in hydraulic and civil engineering from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore in 1957, finishing his education at age 23 and moving to the United States that year. He earned a master's degree in structural engineering from the University of Illinois in 1959. Career. In 1960, Iyengar was hired as a structural engineer in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. While there, he bonded with structural engineer Fazlur Khan, a fellow alum of the University of Illinois, who Iyengar came to regard as an "inspiration and a good friend." Together, they encouraged the office to get a computer the IBM 1620 and developed 60 structural computer programs. He went on to serve as the director of Structural Engineering at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill's Chicago office from 1975 to 1992 and eventually as partner. Throughout his career, Iyengar has worked with notable architects such as Bruce Graham, Frank Gehry and Walter Netsch. Passionate about his collaborations with architects during a time when structural engineering was modernizing with advances in computer technology, Iyengar considered it "imperative for engineers to evolve with today's new technologies and be able to reinvent themselves through the powerful process of computer visualization." Projects. Iyengar has been involved in many notable projects such as the John Hancock Center, Sears Tower, the Anaheim Stadium expansion, the Soldier Field renovation, the McCormick Exposition Center in Chicago, the Convention Center in Hong Kong, Broadgate Phase 11, the Hotel Artes in Barcelona, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, and Millennium Park in Chicago. John Hancock Center. Iyengar served as structural project engineer on the John Hancock Center, led by senior engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan and architect Bruce Graham. The iconic X braced tubular system of the Hancock was one of the first projects to use SOM Chicago's computer programs to verify and supplement hand calculations. When completed in 1969, it was the second tallest building in the world. Sears Tower. Iyengar considered the Sears Tower one of his most significant projects, describing the experience as "what it must have felt like to build the Eiffel Tower to create art out of structural technology." As with the John Hancock Center, Iyengar again served as structural project engineer under senior engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan and architect Bruce Graham. Instead of the X bracing used in the Hancock, a bundled tube system was developed. When completed in 1982, it was the tallest building in the world for 16 years. McCormick Place North. In 1986, Iyengar collaborated again with SOM architect Bruce Graham on the cable stayed steel roof of the McCormick Exposition Center in Chicago. 4500 tons of steel were hung from cables supported by concrete pylons. The project was deemed an "engineering triumph" by Chicago Tribune architecture critic Paul Gapp. Broadgate Exchange House. The Broadgate Phase 11 Exchange House in London was one of Iyengar's most innovative structural engineering works. The building is directly over the top of Liverpool Street Station, a high traffic railroad station. But the rail station could not be touched so no supporting column could touch the ground. To solve this problem three different structural systems were used to support the 10 story tall building over the 78 meter clear span. These were an X braced truss system, a 10 story catenary suspension system, and a parabolic arch system, resulting in a kind of building bridge hybrid. Completed in 1990, the building was awarded the Twenty five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects in 2015 as a testament to its "enduring significance." Bilbao Guggenheim. Iyengar was invited by architect Frank Gehry to join the design team for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. Iyengar continued to work on the project after his retirement in 1992, being "heavily involved" in developing the steel trusses to achieve the large column free spans desired inside the museum. While working on the Pritzker Pavilion band shell in 2000, Gehry was proud to call Iyengar "one of the best structural engineers." Honors and awards. Iyengar has received numerous awards including the 2006 Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal, the 1999 Ernest E. Howard Award by the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the American Institute of Steel Construction Lifetime Achievement Award for "having made a science out of steel building analysis." Personal life. Iyengar met his wife Ruth Yonan Iyengar at a Sunday night fellowship at the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago. They raised two children, Sona and Jay, in Chicago. After retiring in 1992, Iyengar continued to consult on structural projects. He died on July 4, 2019, due to complications from Parkinson's disease and heart disease in Fort Myers, Florida.

Harvard Faculty abolished all secret societies in 1857, forcing the Chapter to go underground. In 1882, the chapter was reestablished and its constitution drafted. Ten years later, with tensions building between the University and its fraternities, the members of the chapter ceased payment of national dues, surrendering the charter and voting themselves as the Zeta Psi Club of Harvard. In the spring of 1900, a unanimous vote brought the society into the final club fold, ultimately resulting in a formal name change in 1914 to the Spee Club of Harvard. Clubhouse. The early quarters of the Club were several rooms in a wooden house on Brattle Street. In the fall of 1886, the members purchased a second location at 44 Church Street, which became its first official clubhouse. Members describe its interior as a "simple, comfortable wooden house with a broad piazza overlooking the pear orchard and a stable nearby for the members' horses." As the Club's presence grew, a third property was acquired and the members erected a building, designed by the late Guy Lowell, at 15 Holyoke Street. Holyoke Street Fire. On 9th March 1931, a large fire swept the building of the Holyoke Street Clubhouse destroying the top floor banquet hall and key rooms in the building. A famous poem recounts the Club's Chef arriving to the clubhouse the next day and serving breakfast on the morning of the fire amidst the smoky partial ruins of the kitchen. 76 Mt Auburn St. After the Holyoke Street fire, the construction of a new clubhouse was commissioned by the current undergraduates. With the University hoping to acquire the Holyoke Street lot to complete its holdings between Massachusetts Avenue and Mount Auburn Street, a trade was made and the Spee became the owner of the larger plot at 76 Mount Auburn St. Part of the land was previously owned by the old Institute of 1770. The building was designed by William T. Aldrich, the famous architect renowned for the design of many famous buildings including the Colony Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the Marine Air Terminal, The Brook, the Union Club, the Walters Art Museum and many others. The opening dinner commemorating the unveiling of the new clubhouse was held on February 20 1932. The Mount Auburn St location still serves as the Spee Club's current clubhouse.

Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers is a 2005 book by engineer Richard Weingardt. The book features a list of 32 engineering legends from the 1700s to the present, including Fazlur Khan, Hal Iyengar, Tung Yen Lin, Benjamin Wright, and Fred Severud. Weingardt describes how the ingenuity of these engineers, many of whom were immigrants to the United States, revolutionized the world, and how people take so many things for granted which were made possible because of the genius of these engineers. The book discusses the fact that while the engineering achievements are regularly recognized, the engineers themselves are rarely discussed. These engineers should become common household names. The book explores the personal lives and professional accomplishments of its subjects, providing an in depth look at the people behind these achievements. The book also illustrates the diversity surrounding these engineers, such as their differing backgrounds, their reasons for becoming engineers, the obstacles they faced, and their work in different disciplines of civil engineering. In the foreword, Henry Petroski describes the book as a work that "cannot help but inspire engineers, future engineers, and all who benefit (and will continue to benefit) from their work".

Operation Primicia ("Scoop") was a large guerrilla assault that took place on 5 October 1975, in Formosa, Argentina. It was the largest attack ever launched by the paramilitary group Putineros, which attempted to seize the barracks of the 29th Forest Infantry Regiment. The incident worsened the Dirty War, and indirectly led to the 1976 Argentine coup d' tat the following year. Overview. The attack was carried out in five phases. Firstly, Montoneros hijacked a flight of Aerol neas Argentinas from the province of Corrientes (with 102 passengers and six crew). The airliner, a Boeing 737 200, was redirected to Formosa. The Formosa International Airport was captured at the same time by Montoneros gunmen already in the province. During this attack they fired a rocket propelled grenade at a police car, killing a police officer and wounding another. The group held 200 hostages at the airport. Then, they assaulted the 29th infantry regiment. The surviving gunmen escaped in the Boeing and a Cessna 182. The Boeing landed in the countryside near Rafaela, Santa Fe Province, and the Cessna on a ricefield in Corrientes Province. The attack was planned by Ra l Yaguer and approved by Montoneros' commanders Mario Firmenich, Roberto Perd a and Roberto Quieto. Attack on the barracks. Montoneros attacked the Regiment facilities at 16:25, the time of the local siesta. Most military personnel were on leave: some of them had a day off, and others were sleeping at the military neighbourhood next to the regiment. Montoneros thought that the remaining soldiers, most of them just young conscripts, would join them, but they did not. Ten conscripts and two policemen died during the attack, and a total of 28 people died during the whole operation. Montoneros expected to seize some 200 FN FAL assault rifles, but could only take 50. Consequences. The acting president of Argentina at that time was talo L der, as Isabel Mart nez de Per n had taken a leave of absence. L der signed three decrees urging the military to "annihilate the subversive elements". The armed forces were already waging the Operativo Independencia against the Maoist ERP in the Tucum n Province. This decree expanded their area of operations to the whole country, as neither the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance nor the police were enough to stop the guerrillas. There was wide support for L der to stay as president, but Isabel Per n returned to the presidency. The military deposed her during the 1976 Argentine coup d' tat, and continued the Dirty War during the "National Reorganization Process". Montoneros and ERP were eventually defeated. The military fell from power in 1983, and the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) listed several thousand forced disappearances carried out by the military during the conflict with the guerrillas. The late president N stor Kirchner made a controversial change to the CONADEP report in 2006. He included the gunmen that died during the attacks as victims of state terrorism, allowing their relatives to receive state compensations.

The Karachi affair (), otherwise known as Agosta Submarine scandal, was a major military scandal that took place in the second administration of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, involving the presidencies of Fran ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac in 1992 97. The scandal involved the payment of massive commissions and kickbacks between France and Pakistan over the negotiations to acquire "Agosta" 90B class submarines. The submarines utilized the emerging air independent propulsion (AIP) proprietary designs, which Pakistan was eager to acquire over the nuclear submarines. In 1992, the Benazir administration began negotiating with French President Fran ois Mitterrand to procure the designs for the expensive and complex submarine, eventually signing the contract in 1994 for a sum equivalent to 826 million ($996m). Negotiations and the decision making for defense procurement with France was extremely controversial, with the United Kingdom later entering in the competition by offering its four "Upholder" class submarines, which were being decommissioned from the military service with the Royal Navy. The Pakistan Navy NHQ wanted to procure the four used British manufactured diesel electric "Upholder" class submarines, which were already available and at a lesser cost than newly build "Agosta"s, which were still in the prototype phase, and would have taken years to manufacture and deliver. Nonetheless, the Benazir administration selected the "Agosta", taking advantage of the lucrative financial credits provided by France. Commissions of 6.25% of the contract, approximately 50 million, were paid out to the lobbying firms in Pakistan and France. Some 50m were allegedly paid as "sweeteners" to various senior Pakistan Navy admirals and officers as well as the political leaders. In 1996 97, the Naval Intelligence led by its Director General, Rear Admiral Tanvir Ahmed, secretly launched its investigations into this matter and began collecting physical evidence that eventually led to the exposure of Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Mansurul Haq, in receiving massive monetary commissions in 1997. Massive media coverage and the news of the dismissals of one and two star admirals tarnished the image of the Navy, with Admiral Fasih Bokhari, who took over the command of the Navy from Admiral Mansurul Haq, forced to attempt damage control of the situation. In 1990s, it was legal in France to award monetary commissions and kickbacks to the political lobbyists involved in the bilateral deals until France began partied and ratified the OECD Convention that led to the outlawing the practice of awarding monetary commissions in 2000. Since its exposure in the news media of both France and Pakistan, the scandal has been involved in various investigative journalism and attracted sensations and conspiracy theories in both countries, including this scandal's allegement of financing the political campaign of then Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in the presidential elections took place in 1995. Upon electing President Jacques Chirac cancelled the commissions and kickbacks, angering many officials in Pakistan and France according to the media reports. Other theories and subsequent investigative journalist reports alleged that the bus bombing on 8 May 2002 in Karachi that killed eleven French engineers in Karachi was in retaliation for the cancellation of these commissions. This theory was rejected by the Government of Pakistan when the FIA and the CID made potential discovery in linking the HuM and the al Qaeda had carried out the terrorist attack in Karachi, mistaking the French nationals for the Americans. Background. Negotiations and procurement. Plans to replace the ageing "Hangor" class diesel electric submarines with nuclear submarines were aggressively pursued by then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey as a counter to Indian Navy activities in 1990. The motivation for procuring nuclear submarines was partly due to the Indian Navy's lease of the ageing "K 43", a "Charlie" class submarine, from the Soviet Union in 1990, and Chairman Joint chiefs Adm. Sirohey had been negotiating with the Chinese Navy to acquire the short term lease for the submarine, the "Han". Pakistan abandoned talks with the Chinese Navy after the Indian contract with the Soviet Union was terminated over training issues and restrictions on Indian sailors accessing the missile control room and reactor compartment of the "Charlie" class submarine. In 1990, Pakistan entered in negotiation with Sweden, China, and France over the procurement and acquisition of submarines with air independent propulsion as a substitute for nuclear powered submarines. Sweden offered their "Gotland" class submarines with an AIP technology, while China offered the diesel electric, "Type 035" submarines at a price tag of $US 180 million, which was $US 83 million cheaper than the French submarines. The Chinese offer was rejected partly due to Navy exploring the idea of acquiring AIP technology, despite the fact that more Chinese submarines were available to buy. Due to the expensive procurement of the "Gotland" class and that the "Type 035" was comparatively outdated, the Navy abandoned their talks with Swedish and Chinese governments, and consequently the Pakistan government entered talks with the French government. Upon hearing the news in 1992 93, the Chinese government reportedly offered to sell off their "Han" class nuclear submarine at price tag of $63 million USD, which Pakistani war strategists were less enthusiastic due to the submarine's noise and performance as they view it as "less tactical advantage" for Pakistan. Eventually, Pakistan entered in negotiation with France over the procurement of the "Agosta 90Bravo" submarines after the French designer, the DCNS, presented the "Agosta" 90B prototype in 1992. At this time, the personal connections between Chief of Naval Staff Admiral S. M. Khan and British First Sea Lord Admiral of the Fleet Sir Julian Oswald resulted in the British government selling the Type 21 frigates to Pakistan in 1993 94. Learning that Pakistan was in the market for submarines, the Royal Navy entered in the competition by offered their four "Upholder" class diesel electric submarines to the Pakistan Navy, an offer which was favored by the naval chief Adm. S.M. Khan , who began lobbying for the British submarines over the French submarines. The United Kingdom formally entered in the competition with France in 1993 94, offering their four British manufactured "Upholder" class submarines, which were available to immediate transfer for a much lower price than the French offer. Although Admiral Khan favored procuring the British submarines, his Vice Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral A. U. Khan had provided strong lobbying in the government of procuring the technology and proprietary designs of "Agosta" submarine from France rather than procuring the readily available British submarines. There was a strong lobby for French technology over the British technology, Rear Admiral Fasih Bokhari, DCNS (Supply) and Rear Admiral Aziz Mirza, then Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Defense (MoD) also favored acquiring the "Agosta 90Bravos" over the "Upholder"s. When the retirement of Admiral S.M. Khan was confirmed in 1994, Aftab Mirani, the Defense Minister in the Bhutto government informed Adm. Khan that the final decision was for the acquisition of the French technology over the British second hand submarines. Intermediaries, commissions, and kickbacks. In 1993, the Bainazir government had been considering acquiring and commissioning the four diesel electric "Upholder" class submarines from the United Kingdom, which were made available after Pakistan had bought the "Amazon" class frigates and commissioned them into the Pakistan Navy as the "Tariq" class in 1994. With the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral S.M. Khan lobbying for the "Upholder" class boats, which were available at a much lower price and in greater numbers than the French offer, others in his naval staff, including Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS) V Adm. A.U. Khan and R Adm. Fasih Bokhari, the DCNS (Supply), who were submariners by profession and had trained in the French built "Hangor" class submarines, were on the idea of utilizing the air independent propulsion technology that French Navy were offering. Nonetheless, the Navy NHQ recommended that the Finance ministry and the Defence production ministry acquire the "Upholder" class which were then readily available, for a lower prince while the "Agosta"s had yet to be built, and would have taken years to be delivered. Upon hearing of the United Kingdom's offer, the French government offered extremely lucrative monetary offers and generous financial credits to the Pakistan government in its annual federal budgets if it selected the "Agosta" 90Bravo submarines, which had the additional advantage of keeping the "underemployed KSEW in Karachi" in employment and works. Despite the strong political opposition by India over this deal in 1994, French President Fran ois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto signed off a submarine procurement deal that was initially budgeted at $520 million but the programme of technology transfer cost $950 million, for which France first provided loans that were to be paid in five to six years. In 1994, the French government awarded the defence contracts to DCNS, Thales, Dassault Syst mes, as the French Navy's "Forces Sous marines" took the responsibility of providing training to Pakistan Navy's submarine command (SUBCOM). In Pakistan, the entire contract was awarded to KSEW by the Government of Pakistan, that opened the employment opportunities in self sustainability while issuing major tender offers to unemployed heavy machine industry, as private accounting firms were hired as civilian defense contractors to oversee the accounting and finances. In 1994 96, the French government paid large amounts of commissions and kickbacks paid in Euros to lobbying firms in Pakistan and France as part of the common practice a practice that the Pakistani government also followed to award commissions paid in Pakistan Rupees to naval officers and political figures to maintain the support of the program despite its cost. This policy was intended to "convince" political leaders and military officials, but such practices were declared illegal in France until the signing of the OECD Convention against Corruption in 2000. The French state owned consortium, the SOFEMA, channeled money to political and military officials through front companies and individuals in Pakistan and France. The names of the recipients are still kept as secret but the amounts are known and were reported to the French Ministry of Finance and Pakistan Ministry of Finance in 2000, as these commissions are 6.25% of the contract amount. The French newspaper, "Lib ration", revealed that payments of SOFEMA continued until 2001, when they were stopped by former French President Jacques Chirac. Naval Intelligence and sting operations. As early as 1995, the Naval Intelligence had been tracking news of military officials being financially paid by France and Pakistan in a program oversaw by the Chief of Naval Staff Adm. Mansurul Haq. Knowledge on commission being paid to the naval officials were exposed when Naval Intelligence's spy chief Rear Admiral Javed Iqbal led the arrest of the project engineer, Capt. Z.U. Alvi at the Karachi Naval Dockyard, based on an accidental intelligence based on the sting operation. Capt. Alvi who confirmed his contacts with Zafar Iqbal, a defence contractor, and accepted "receiving millions of and R$ in the briefcase(s)" only to be handed over to the interested military and political figures. Civilian defense contractor, Zafar Iqbal, was a businessman who had financial ties with the Bhutto Zardari family and had access to the sensitive accounting departments linked to the Navy NHQ in Islamabad, which prompted the Naval Intelligence to conduct the further inquiry into business deals of Iqbal after receiving a reference from an anonymous naval officer. The investigative leads, case studies, and the evidences were then compiled by the R Adm. Javed Iqbal who passed it further to the acting director in 1995. The Naval Intelligence, under acting director Cdre. Shahid Ashraf, did overlooked into this matter but the efforts were hampered when Cdre. Ashraf reportedly confronted Adm. Masurul Haq, and later joined the scheme when he accepted the subsequent financial amount that was transferred to Ashraf's account by Adm. Mansurul Haq in 1995. It was not until 1996 when new director, Rear Admiral Tanvir Ahmed, began overlooking into this matter and dug out the cover up intelligence information in this matter, eventually launching his own investigation with new and most reliable leads that he had discovered when he overlooked into this matter. In 1997, the scandal was eventually exposed in the news media by director of naval intelligence, Rear Admiral Tanvir Ahmed when he authorized a second sting operation that the arrests of several high ranking admirals in the Navy, and Cdre. Ashraf who was departed to the United Kingdom to attend the war course at the Royal College of Defence Studies in Great Britain, was eventually recalled to face the court martial. Aftermath and Investigations. Pakistan: Relief of Mansurul Haq and massive cover ups. In 1997, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif signed the relief papers that dismissed the commission of Admiral Mansurul Haq, and was arrested for a brief time by the Naval Police but was released when Naval Intelligence investigations led by R Adm. Ahmad were failed to produce any evidence against him in 1998. In 1999, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) under Cdre. Muhammad Zakaullah, announced to take over of inquiries and requested the extradition of Adm. Mansurul Haq from the United States in 2001 in light of new evidences surfaced. Mansurul Haq later faced the accountability and transferred more than $9.5 million, though a plea bargain deal that ensure his release, into the Navy's account in 2003 04 an amount that was said to be enough to pay the salaries of entire Navy for two years. In 1999 2005, there were several indictments and convictions held against civilian contractors and politicians by the courts in Pakistan in light of the inquiries conducted by the NAB and the FIA who were able to recover the large sum of amount into national treasury through the plea bargains. Inquiries and findings that involved several high ranking admirals were subjected to a massive cover up by the Musharraf administration when the release of Cdre. Ashraf and Capt. Liaquat Ali Malik was authorized under the unknown circumstances in 2002 03. Major allegations were also directed towards the senior ranking army generals who played a crucial role in covering up other defence deals with France and Ukraine when Agosta commission case was exposed in 2000 03 to prevent tarnishing the further image of the military in the public. In France, the NAB and the FIA investigations also implicated the civilian defence contractor, Amir Lodhi (brother Dr. Maliha Lodhi), whose share was 2.9 million, Aftab Shaban Mirani, the Defence Minister in Benazir's administration, Zafar Iqbal, a civilian defence contractor, Hazar Bijarani, Defence Production minister in Benazir administration, and A.A. Zardari, Investment minister in Benazir's administration. According to the FIA and NAB, Amir Lodhi was a close associate and business partner of Asif Ali Zardari and Benazir Bhutto. In 2010, Cdre. Ashraf leveled serious allegations on Sharif family of being benefactory of the scheme, though he failed to provide subsequent evidences. The NAB and the FIA reportedly recovered more than ~$30 million from the benefitted parties though it was reported that ~$28 million were still untraceable and unaccounted for. France: Court investigations and indictments. When the scandal became public in 1997 by the Naval Intelligence, the French court opened the inquiry into this matter as French prosecutors were able to retrieve evidences from their Pakistani counterparts. The French media widely reported that Ziad Takieddine, a Lebanese French civilian contractor, received millions of Euros as part of his commission, and then paid off lobbying firms in Pakistan and France in their respected currencies. The French courts eventually opened the inquiries and founded that the large part of the commission was used to finance the presidential campaign of Edouard Balladur in 1995. The French court investigation also founded the connection of Paul Manafort, an American adviser to French presidential candidate Edouard Balladur, into this weapons trade with Pakistan. On April 26, 1995, it was reported that 8.8 million were donated to the presidential campaign of former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur from the account of Cr dit du Nord, only three days after the first round of presidential elections. Based on the court's insights, the French Police detailed Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, the former French culture minister in Balludur's government, for questioning about the kickbacks on "Agosta 90Brave" submarines deal which may have funded the Edouard Balladur's failed 1995 presidential campaign. On 3 July 2012, French police raided Nicolas Sarkozy's private residence and campaign office as part of their probe into claims that he was involved in illegal political campaign financing. The French prosecutors leveled allegations on French politicians of their involvement in selling the "Agosta" submarine commissions that was used in political campaigns. Nicolas Sarkozy who was the Finance minister in Balladur's government in 1995, had denied any involvement in the scandal. Legacy and later events. Bus bombing in Karachi and lawsuits. In the morning of 8 May 2002, a man driving an explosive laden Honda Civic parallel to the Daewoo city bus outside the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi, detonated his car with the moving bus, ripping the bus apart and severely damaging the hotel. In this attack, it was reported that eleven of the French navy's engineers and two Pakistani engineers were killed while 40 others were injured in this attack. The French engineers were working with their Pakistani counterparts to assemble the machined parts of the Agosta 90"Bravo" submarines in Naval Dockyard in Karachi Initial blames were put on the Indian branch of al Qaeda, and later Pakistani crime scene investigators linked it with HuM operatives who later confessed that the attacks were supposed to target the Americans but mistakingly attacked the French nationals. The European media later placed the blame on the Pakistani military who orchestrated this attack in retaliation for the cancellation of these commissions this theory was rejected by the Pakistan MoI after Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider held a televised press conference to release the details of mastermind, Sharib Zubair, arrested on 18 September 2002. The families of eleven killed French engineers filed multiple lawsuits in Sindh High Court with their lawyers arguing for financial compensation from the governments of both nations while seeking the death penalties for those accused, and the two HuM operatives were sentenced to death for the bombing in 2003. The suspected bomb maker, Mufti Mohammad Sabir, was arrested in Karachi on 8 September 2005 and hanged in 2014. In series of lawsuits filed by the families of French engineers, there were several convictions on many suspected HuM operatives who were either hanged or facing solitary confinement in successive years, though the courts had acquitted three defendants by 2009 due to lack of evidences. According to French "Lib ration", the links between the attack and the activities of the DCNS were raised by it, and by American investigators in 2002 who joined the investigation. The DCNS recruited Claude Th venet, an official from the DST, who worked with Tariq Pervez, a lead investigator in the FIA's investigation into corruption in this scandal and events leading towards targeting the French nationals, to investigate the circumstances of the attack. Th venet report, titled: "Nautilus", dated 11 September 2002, concluded that it was related to the discontinuation of payment of commissions. This report, although intended as confidential, was seized by the judges in the spring of 2008, in connection with another case, and forwarded to Judge Marc Tr vidic. The Pakistani investigators contested the French findings and cited their theory that the attack was indeed carried out by HuM and al Qaeda, mistaking the French nationals for the Americans. In 2013, Mansurul Haq filed a lawsuit against the Government of Pakistan, seeking to restore his military rank and medical pensions, at the Sindh High Court. The Sindh High Court agreed upon restoring the rank (as former) but not the medical pensions that are enjoyed by the retired four star officers in the Pakistani military Haq later died from chronic heart disease in 2018. Further criticism in 2010 13. In 2002 03, the Navy, NAB, FIA and the Musharraf administration had to sustained strong criticism over the handling of the scandal by the former spies and investigators who served in the Naval Intelligence. Within the Navy, the officers from the Surface Command, alongside with Aviation Command (NAVCOM) blamed the officers in the Submarine Command (COMSUBS) of receiving the commissions and kickbacks. In 2010, the Investigative journalism in this matter was launched by journalists from Dawn News and Geo News after Asif Ali Zardari assume the presidency in 2008. According to V Adm. Javed Iqbal in 2013, it was Adm. S.M. Khan, the Navy chief in 1994, who "was the real person to take away the big chunk because the deal was implemented in his tenure." Navy investigator, R Adm. Tanvir Ahmed, also backed and echoed Adm. Iqbal's allegation and scrutinized Adm. S.M. Khan of receiving the commissions and kickbacks while giving criticism to Navy's naval crime investigation branch for singling out Mansurul Haq. The Navy's investigators, V Adm. Javed Iqbal and R Adm. Ahmad, reportedly testified in media that the "top brass of the Navy's leadership at that time had come from the Submarine Command (SUBCOM), including Vice Admiral A. U. Khan, Adm. Abdul Aziz Mirza, and Adm. Fasih Bokhari, which according to investigators, were central in covering up the scandal by quietly closing the investigations. Major allegations also directed towards the Pakistan Army's generals who worked towards with their naval counterparts to cover up the investigations to prevent maligning the image of the Navy and the military as whole. In 2011, the "News International" editorial gave criticism to Fasih Bokhari of quietly closed the case against retired Mansurul Haq when the latter was not found guilty but did not take actions against those naval officers who had received kickbacks including Aftab Shaban Mirani who the Defence Minister involved in the affairs."

Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) was a mobile notification service developed by Google that enables third party application developers to send notification data or information from developer run servers to applications that target the Google Android Operating System, as well as applications or extensions developed for the Google Chrome internet browser. It was available to developers free of charge. The GCM Service was first announced in June 2012 as a successor to Google's now defunct Android Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM) service, citing improvements to authentication and delivery, new API endpoints and messaging parameters, and the removal of limitations on API send rates and message sizes. It has been superseded by Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) on May 29, 2019. Development. GCM first launched as Google's Android Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM) service, first featured in Android 2.2 by Google. The transition to Google Cloud Messaging was first announced when the Android service was unveiled on June 27, 2012, at Google I/O. Shortly after announcing the Google Cloud Messaging service, Google published documentation to guide application developers with migrating from the C2DM and onto the new service. Migrating to the service required SDK and code changes, as well as a release of an application update to the publish repository (such as Google Play) for downloading and updating. The Chrome service was announced before Google I/O 2013 in a blog post titled 'Building efficient apps and extensions with push messaging.' At I/O 2015, Google announced a new SDK and iOS support. Technical details. Google Cloud Messaging functions using server APIs and SDKs, both maintained by Google. The GCM has the ability to send push notifications, deep linking commands, and application data. Larger messages can be sent with up to 4 KB of payload data. Upon allowing the application permission to receive and display notifications, the client application sends a registration API request to the Google Cloud Messaging interface to begin the registration process. The GCM Service receives and acknowledges the request and responds by giving the device a "GCM Registration ID", a unique identifier that the developer later uses to send a notification to the individual device. The identifier is stored onto the device, and is typically sent to the developer's application server to be stored. The GCM Registration ID is a randomly generated identifier that does not contain any personal or device information that could allow a developer to discover the personal identity of the user. When the developer wishes to send a notification event to a device, the process begins with an API POST request being sent to the GCM Authentication Service. The POST request includes the GCM Registration ID, priority, optional values and links, and the information that is to be displayed on the device upon its arrival. Upon successful verification of the GCM Registration ID and other credentials, an authentication token is returned. Both identifiers are then sent to the GCM Service to be enqueued and delivered to the device.
Puerto Rico Highway 577 (PR 577) is a short tertiary mountainous state road that connects PR 143 (also known as "Ruta Panor mica" [Scenic Route] in this sector) to the Cerro Maravilla communications towers, in Barrio An n, Ponce, Puerto Rico. The road's northern terminus is at the Cerro Maravilla communications towers atop the Cerro Maravilla mountain, and its southern terminus is at its intersection with PR 143. Route description. PR 577 is a short road, approximately one quarter mile in length. The road's primary purpose is to provide access to the television, radio and telephone communications towers located at the top of the Cerro Maravilla mountain. The road is somewhat steep, but it is safe to climb it in an automobile. Care must be exercised, however, if using the road while raining. It is an asphalt road. The road is not a full two lane road but, instead, as it is the case with many of Puerto Rico's mountain roads, it is approximately 1 and 1/2 lanes wide. As a result, if traveling this road in a vehicle, it is necessary to reduce the speed to almost a crawl when another vehicle is approaching in the opposite direction. Significance. The Cerro Maravilla mountain gained notoriety in Puerto Rico and internationally as the site where Puerto Rico Police ambushed two young Puerto Rican independence advocates in 1978, murdering both, in an incident now known as the Cerro Maravilla murders. The men, aged 18 and 23, had been lured to the place by an undercover police agent to attempt to destroy the communications towers in an effort to call attention to the incarceration of Puerto Rican political prisoners in the United States. The killing of the two men was covered up by the Puerto Rico Police and several high level Puerto Rico government officials, and were not investigated diligently by the FBI, for which a later FBI director apologized.

On 22 June 2012, a Turkish McDonnell Douglas RF 4E Phantom II reconnaissance jet was intercepted and shot down by the Syrian Army in international airspace, after having violated Syrian airspace. The jet's pilots were killed; both Turkish and Syrian forces searched for them before recovering their bodies in early July. The incident was part of a series of incidents between Turkey and Syria since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War and greatly escalated the tensions between the two countries. Background. Syria Turkey relations were already marred by the Turkish pilgrim bus attack. Also, on 9 April 2012, the Syrian envoy to Turkey was summoned after Syrian forces fired across the Syria Turkey border. At least two people were killed and many others injured in the incident. Event. The reconnaissance aircraft of type RF 4E belonged to the 173rd Wing at the 7th Main Jet Base Group Command stationed at the Erha Air Base in Malatya. The aircraft, piloted by Flight lieutenant G khan Ertan and Flying officer Hasan H seyin Aksoy, took off on 22 June 2012 with the task to help test the Turkish radar system. According to radar records, the aircraft was flying between Cyprus and Hatay over the Mediterranean Sea at about FL210, an altitude of 21,000 feet, at 11:06 hours local time (08:06 UTC). For radar test purposes, it descended as it approached Hatay. At 11:14 hours, the RF 4E was at FL086, and nine minutes later it had descended to FL075 just over Hatay. At 11:23 hours, the aircraft changed its course, heading now for Mediterranean Sea and continued to descend. At 11:37, it had reached FL020 and was descending further for radar test purposes. The aircraft arrived at 11:42 on the boundary of Syrian sovereign airspace, out from the coastline, flying at 200 ft. At this point, the aircraft violated Syrian airspace, and flew around for five minutes within its airspace. A Turkish radar base controlling the flight warned the RF 4E to change its course immediately and leave that airspace. At 11:47, it left Syrian airspace and took a northerly course in the direction of Hatay, ascending to FL030. During the airspace violation and afterwards, the aircraft received no warning or admonishment from Syrian military authorities. The pilots changed their course once again into the Mediterranean Sea to proceed with their mission of radar testing. At 11:50, the pilots asked the Turkish radar base for assistance on route information, so that they would not violate Syrian airspace again. The aircraft was flying in international airspace and visible on radar screens until 12:02. The RF 4E was struck by a Syrian surface to air missile off the coast. The aircrew may have been alerted to a missile approaching and attempted unsuccessfully to evade. It was the first time that any variant of the F 4 had been shot down since the Gulf War. Aftermath. The navies of Turkey and Syria searched for the missing aircraft and crew. Turkish personnel recovered their bodies in early July 2012. United States research vessel EV "Nautilus" arrived three days later at the crash site to join the search and rescue operations. Her two remotely operated vehicles "Hercules" and "Argus" conducted search at the seabed in depth and located the debris of the aircraft, and brought parts of the downed jet up to the surface. The bodies of the pilots were brought up in a 45 minute operation on 4 July 2012 with the help of a device constructed specially for this purpose. The Syrian military alleged that the fighter aircraft had violated Syrian airspace. Turkish president Abdullah G l and other spokesmen did not confirm this, though G l said that "it is routine for jet fighters to sometimes fly in and out over [national] borders". G l stated that "it is not possible to cover over a thing like this. Whatever is necessary will no doubt be done." A Turkish political party leader claimed that the jet had been shot down by a Russian warship, and Deputy Prime Minister B lent Ar n also claimed that it was hit by a laser guided or heat seeking missile, not anti aircraft fire as the Syrian Government claimed. On 3 July 2012, the Syrian President said that he regretted the incident and would not allow any open conflict with Turkey. The change in Turkey's policy towards Syrian attacks led to a series of border clashes in October.

It is the second track and lead single from her fifth studio album "Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea", and was released on 13 November 2000 on Island Records. The song was written by Harvey and self produced with Mick Harvey and Rob Ellis. Upon its release, "Good Fortune" received positive critical acclaim and charted in both France and the United Kingdom, peaking at number 100 and number 41 respectively. The song had an accompanying music video, directed by Sophie Muller. Origin and recording. "Good Fortune" was recorded during the sessions for "Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea" throughout March and April 2000 at Linford Manor in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. The song was one of nineteen songs PJ Harvey had written for the album, alongside the singles b sides "Memphis" and "66 Promises." Although most of "Good Fortune" was recorded in studio, parts of the song were recorded alone by Harvey on a 4 track cassette recorder in New York City and Dorset. The song was mixed by Victor Van Vugt at the Fallout Shelter in May 2000. Composition. "Good Fortune" was written by Harvey and produced by Harvey, multi instrumentalist Mick Harvey, and former bandmate Rob Ellis. It is set in common time () and composed in the key of A minor. The verse follows a repetitive pattern of two chords (Am7 G6) and the final refrains of each verse repeat two chords (C F5). The chorus has a rising bass progression composed of four chords (Am7 G6/B C D) and the song ends on G5. The song's lyrics make allusions to New York, a theme shared with other songs on "Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea". She lived in New York prior to the recording of the album. Release and reception. "Good Fortune" was released in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2000 on Island Records. It was the lead single from "Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea" and was pressed on CD and 7" vinyl. Each pressing contained alternate b sides, including "66 Promises", "Memphis" and "30." An enhanced CD version was released in Australia featuring all b sides, two music videos and an electronic press kit. Promotional CDs were released for radio airplay in the United States and Spain. The song charted on the French Singles Chart, peaking at number 100, and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 41. Critical reception to "Good Fortune" was positive. A number of reviews drew comparisons between Harvey and fellow female musicians Chrissie Hynde and Patti Smith. Allmusic reviewer Heather Phares described "Good Fortune" as the song "on which Harvey channels both Chrissie Hynde's sexy tough girl and Patti Smith's ferocious yelp." "NME"s review drew a similar Patti Smith comparison, stating "Harvey's adopted her mentor's positivity, so that the urban vignettes are filled with a lust for life" and Pitchfork Media said "'Good Fortune' sustains a similar but even more banal pop sound, with Harvey distinctly recalling Chrissie Hynde, both musically and vocally." Music video. The music video for "Good Fortune" was directed by Sophie Muller. The video features Harvey walking and running through the streets of London at night and ending with Harvey entering a Kebab takeaway. The recording of the video was approximately six hours long with Harvey taking the same route each take but "changing what [she] was doing all of the time." The video shoot faced a number of difficulties, most regarding the camera operator. The camera operator had to walk backwards while filming and his assistants had to guide him. The lighting crew had difficulty maintaining the correct lighting due to Harvey's improvised movement. Speaking of the experience, Harvey said: "the crew would have to consciously be aware all the time of where I was moving because they might have to duck to get out of the line of vision. It was hilarious because then I kind of cottoned on to if I would move in a certain position I'd be able to watch the whole fifteen piece male crew hit the ground immediately. So, a couple of times I'd do it on purpose and bang! Flat down as quick as they could." Personnel. All personnel credits adapted from the "Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea"s liner notes.

Allan Lee Graf (born December 16, 1949) is an American athlete, actor, stuntman and director. A high school All American football player at San Fernando in Los Angeles, California, Graf played offensive guard for the undefeated national champion University of Southern California Trojans in 1972. After a brief experience playing professional football, Graf stumbled into stunt work, and over time has become a stunt coordinator in Hollywood, coordinating stunts in football movies like "Any Given Sunday" and "Friday Night Lights". Graf likes to cast himself in onscreen stunt roles, and has appeared in many television shows and movies. Graf has become a second unit director, working on films such as "Wayne's World", "The Replacements", "The Waterboy", "We Were Soldiers", and "Jerry Maguire". Early life and education. Allan Lee Graf was raised in Sylmar, California, but transferred to San Fernando High School in tenth grade. According to Graf, San Fernando was the best high school football program in the state in the 1970s. Though originally from mostly white Sylmar, Graf proved himself sufficiently as a defensive player at San Fernando to be elected captain of the more integrated Tigers team as a senior. In 1968, the San Fernando Tigers won the Los Angeles City High School football championship, going undefeated; Graf was selected L.A. City co player of the year and a Parade Magazine All American at defensive tackle. Heavily recruited by Pac 8 universities, Graf opted to stay in his native Los Angeles to play for John McKay and the University of Southern California Trojans. Graf was unhappy when line coach Rod Humenuik told him he'd be playing offensive tackle. Graf liked to tackle offensive ball carriers; with his natural aggressiveness, he felt he would play better on defense. Humenuik said: "With your speed you're a great pulling guard. You have a natural tendency to pull with your hips." Graf started three years at tackle for the Trojans. During USC's remarkable undefeated 1972 season, Graf played with Trojan legends Lynn Swann, Pat Haden and Sam Cunningham, helped Anthony Davis to get a record six touchdowns against rival Notre Dame, and won a national championship ring after defeating Ohio State in the 1973 Rose Bowl. The 1972 USC Trojans have sometimes been classed among the best college football teams of all time. Thirty three teammates on the 1972 roster would eventually be drafted by teams in the National Football League, including five first round picks. Career. Football. Unpicked in the 1973 NFL Draft, Graf attended the Los Angeles Rams' 1973 fall training camp as a free agent. Playing behind All Pro Tom Mack in camp, Graf asked to be traded or released, but was the last man cut from camp, leaving him without an NFL contract. Graf was one of several Trojan graduates to join the Portland Storm franchise in the new World Football League, but after the league folded in the middle of its second season, Graf thought his football career was behind him. Film. While still playing for the Portland Storm, Graf had taken side work with Disney in Santa Clarita, acting as stunt double to Chicago Bears player Dick Butkus on a children's sports comedy "Gus" about a field goal kicking mule. Butkus invited Graf to double for him on television projects several times in the following years, and soon Graf was getting stunt work on his own. Frequent collaborations with director Walter Hill gave Graf the experience and confidence to do more than just stunt work; in 1989 he was asked by Hill not only to coordinate stunts for his new film "Johnny Handsome", but also to direct the film's second unit, a first for Graf. Graf's stunt coordination received much attention in Walter Hill's 1990 film "Another 48 Hrs.", after he performed a "cannon roll" using a school bus at speed, lifting the bus in the air with dynamite, and rolling it down the highway for . Sports films. Graf's special connection with sports has led him to be one of Hollywood's most capable and experienced football stunt coordinators. Starting with "Gus", Graf has performed or coordinated stunts in over a dozen football related films. For "Friday Night Lights" Graf personally interviewed over 900 candidates for a forty man roster, including doubles for the actors involved. After deciding on talent, Graf put together a playbook and started the roster running plays, gradually working the actors into the practices. "My rule of thumb is we never hit an actor. We can't afford anyone to get hurt. When we did "Any Given Sunday", we could do some controlled stuff, but it is very limited how much you can do." Graf is often called "Coach" on set. Referring to 2000's "The Replacements" reporter Liz Segal said, "Staging plays for Howard Deutch's comedy about replacement players during the 1987 NFL strike gave Graf his biggest thrill ever. To get that real pro football feel, some sequences had to be filmed during a Baltimore Ravens' halftime." As the result of his experience coordinating stunts on sports movies, Graf has developed a regular "team" of stuntmen he can call on to get just the right look for the film. Graf's knowledge of the history of the game makes him especially useful. "for "", based on Syracuse's Ernie Davis in 1961 becoming the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy, [Graf] needed smaller players and ones who could adopt that era's playing styles." Second Unit Director. Graf has directed the second unit of photography on many sports related motion pictures where his stunt coordination made him a key decision maker, but he has also directed second unit in many mainstream comedies, starting with "Wayne's World" in 1992. Especially in collaboration with Walter Hill, with whom he shares association in many movie projects, Graf's experience has grown in the action film genre, especially in the Western. In 2004, Graf helped Hill create and execute realistic stunts for the premiere of David Milch's "Deadwood" television series on HBO. Graf was himself cast as the bodyguard "Captain Joe Turner" of series antagonist George Hearst. In episode five of the third season, Graf's character and his camp rival Dan Dority (portrayed by William Earl Brown) engaged in a climactic and gritty five minute bare knuckle brawl which was described by one reviewer as "a bloody marvel." Personal life. Graf and wife Betty have three children, all USC alums or students: Derek, Nicole and Kevin. Graf's sons have played football as legacies at USC: Derek Graf played center and right offensive tackle for the 2002 squad, and Kevin Graf started at right offensive tackle for 37 games before graduation.

When State Representative Ron Reagan was unable to seek re election in 2010 due to term limits, Steube ran to succeed him in the 67th District, which was based in southern Hillsborough County, eastern Manatee County, and northern Sarasota County, stretching from Apollo Beach to Fruitville. He received an endorsement from United States Congressman Vern Buchanan, who declared that Steube was "extremely knowledgeable of the district and the district's issues." In the Republican primary, he faced Jeremiah J. Guccione and Robert McKann, whom he was able to easily defeat, receiving 53% of the vote to Guccione's 28% and McCann's 19%. He advanced to the general election, where he faced Democratic nominee Z. J. Hafeez and independent candidate John M. Studebaker.

In the end, Steube defeated both his opponents in a landslide, winning 68% of the vote to Hafeez's 27% and Studebaker's 5%. Following the reconfiguration of state legislative districts in 2012, Steube's district was renumbered as the 73rd District.

Pennsylvania", a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." Additionally, Pelosi reprimanded Steube and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions." New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Steube and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit. Pascrell argued that "the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States.

The bill would amend Section 230 by making the law's civil liability protections for "interactive computer services" conditional for market dominant Big Tech platforms.
